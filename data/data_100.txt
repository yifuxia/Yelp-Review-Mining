Bakery items were fresh and surprisingly quite affordable. This place was jam-packed for a weekday lunch. Tons of people were waiting in multiple lines while others were watching around like a hawk to snag a table to eat their meals. These folks are quite organized but so busy that they are little impatient if you haven't decided on what to order or asked for suggestions. They want that line moving. Despite this, they're quite fast and there is a person at the front door directing you to which line you should be in if you're a newbie. There's one line for the regular menu, bakery items, and for cake pick-ups. As for the food, we tried a bit of everything based on the Yelp reviews. We chose this spot because it made Yelp's Top 100 this year. Would I agree it belongs on that list? Maybe. But based off of the five thousand plus reviews, I would say it was a bit overhyped. The food is good, but not \"Oh, man, let's drive 20 miles and wait in a line and stalk people for a table kinda good.\" If it were more centrally located and the not as crowded, I would definitely say stop by and grab a box of goodies and surprise your friends at work. I think the food is more ideal for snacking, potlucks, and parties. I wouldn't come here for a business meeting. It was very loud and I could hardly hear my own thoughts. Btw, we had the following for lunch:Steak sandwich with plantain chips - so so, we might have ordered the wrong sandwich here (3 stars)Potato balls - delicious, crispy, and hot out of the fryer (4 stars)Ham and cheese croquettes - They were OK. (3 stars)Guava Cheese Pastry - My favorite of all the snacks. Definitely order this. I wished I had ordered some more for later. \u00a0(5 stars)Dulche kisses - Good, but wished they were served warm and gooey (4 stars)If I'm in the area, \u00a0I would stop by again just for the Guava Cheese Pastry, and maybe check out their other items. A lot of people seemed to be ordering and picking up cakes mid-day, so I might try that again for next visit. There's also two other locations.

I had the Pan de Lechon while my fiance opted to order the turkey and cheese croissant, we did order a couple of little pastries while we waited for our entrees. We ordered a pan de queso and a meat pie! That meat pie is so good, I had Bryan go back in line to order more.I love that the sandwiches come with fried platanos, like seriously the best idea ever, I picked red onion really does bring that sandwich together. The portion size was great too, I ended up eating half and bringing the other portion to work the next day.

This place is not for the diet-conscious, since just about everything is deep fried or involves some sort of pastry dough--but everything is well worth the calories.My favorites include the cubano sandwich, which is a decent size and each bite is packed with flavor. My favorite dish--and the one they are most well-known for--has to be the guava and cheese pastry. I am not usually a fan of cheese with pastry, but this one is to die for--seriously.
