[{"content": "I am absolutely, one hundred and \u00a0fifty percent, over the moon in love with Portos. I don't \u00a0know what it is ---- wait yes I do! It is their stunning quality desserts and treats, affordable and fair prices, and their friendly staff.I was super late on the Porto's bandwaggon, only recently getting to experience them at their Glendale location and then later at their Burbank location. Since then I have fallen in love with them. I love their potato balls, I love their chocolate mousse -- ANYTHING, and there's this one pastry from there I specifically love but I don't know the name of it, and other people always seem to buy it for me, and whenever I go it's not there.Seriously. Portos, it's an institution.

But if you want a tasty, cheap lunch, or a great option for brightening someone's day with a box of pastries, this is your place.My favorite sandwich is the medianoche, but make sure you order it \"preparada\"--medianoche preparada--and they'll take a chicken croquette and smash it in there with all that roast pork, pickle, and cheese goodness. Whatever you decide to eat, make sure they pack up a box of potato balls (seasoned ground beef inside a sphere of mash potatoes, fried until crisp and golden brown) and some guava cheese danish to take home.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Dara M.", "time": "12/11/2014"}, {"content": "No wait!!! \u00a0Wow!!! \u00a0Line went through so quick I didn't get a chance to feast with the variety of pastries they have to offer.

Luckily the place is pretty big & bright with 2 different lines, both move pretty quick. Menus are available while you wait so you could be browse through what & be ready by the time you're at the front. When it gets busy, it also becomes a pain to find a place to sit. But the bright side, their restrooms smells like fresh baked bread which is nice. Service: Definitely very efficient especially during busy hours. No complaints here. Food: Cheese Roll? You can never just have one... Or a dozen. Dulce de Leche Kisses? Almost like crack in baked good form. Potato balls were good. Sandwiches are ok except the Pan con Bistec which is yummy. Overall: I've been here so many times with family & understand why it's so popular.

New fave place .. I wish I lived closer!! My friend and I went for our first time the woman at the doorway gave us the run down we jumped in line and grabbed food. And then while siting eating I asked her about the Potato Balls. And she came back with 3 FREE ones for us to try!!! I don't eat meat so I scraped that part out but damn was it good! And then I got in the bread and dessert line and told the guy I was so excited to try their sourdough cuz I've never been there before. And he gave me a FREE cheese Danish and FREE Plantain chips!! I seriously walked away spending $1.30 and I got ...1. An AMAZINGGGGGGG chocochip cookie (normally 45\u00a2 whattt!?) 2. A sourdough loaf (the smallest one). 3. Plantain chips and garlic dipping sauce4. A cheese Danish I am a sourdough-aholic so I will say to those other out there, it's pretty damn good. Never got a chance to toast it cuz I ate it too fast. It's got a different texture like a French bread super light and airy. But the taste is phenomenal. Plantain chips- really good but share them I got sick of them after a little bit. AND BUY THE DAMN AMAZING WARM 45\u00a2 INCREDIBLE CHOCOCHIP COOKIE", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Blaire B.", "time": "4/6/2014"}]
