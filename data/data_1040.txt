[{"content": "This place is like a mega bakery - lots of choice, the pastries are quite big and there's lots of people (customers and staff). What surprised me most was probably the price, 2 boxes with of pastries and it was like $40. What?!? How?!? A friend did all the ordering, we had pastry with cheese, with cheese and guava, a sandwich with plantain chips, curry puffs, some other sweet pasties. It was intense. A good experience, followed immediately by a food coma.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Ashleigh D.", "time": "4/6/2014"}, {"content": "Love porto's!!!! Always have to visit whenever i'm in the area. Sandwiches are cheap and delicious, and o m g those plantain chips they have on the side are amazing!! Don't even taste like bananas haha. I've tried the cubano and the medianoche (midnight sandwich), and they're both under $5!!! The only difference between the two is the bread. I think I liked the medianoche sandwich better because of the sweet roll rather than the cuban bread which was too filling for me..The most popular bakery items seem to be the potato balls, cheese rolls, guava cheese rolls, and the empanadas/meat pies! My personal favorites are the potato balls and the chorizo meat pies.The service here is really good. The workers are always friendly and accommodating, so if you're unsure of what you want or what's popular, definitely ask! My friend even got to sample pastries here!The lines also aren't bad here... Or the past two times I've been here they haven't been long at all!

It always leaves me feeling heavy. It's got a lot of fat in it. The pies and cakes are sugary sweet and delicious. Stop for a Cuban coffee and some ham croquettes. Dam it feels good to be a fat man at Porto's bakery. Eat everything in site at this place. It's all good. Get some coffee and sit down outside. You can even take your fat soaked goodness to-go and eat it at home by yourself. No shame when it's this good.

This place just gives me happy feelings with their eclectic selection of foods from fresh Cuban sandwiches, pastries, smoothies, etc. My family and I had lunch with a good friend of ours and I knew this would be a great spot to meet her since I've been here before. I'm not from the Burbank area, so I knew when I came here, I had to get a whole buffet worth of love! I tried the Cuban Beef sandwich (Viega Roja, I think it was??) that came with their legendary plantain chips. Of course I had to order a Potato Ball which is perfectly fried crunchy on the outside and warm and gooy on the inside with seasoned ground beef and mashed potatoes! Talk about a mouth full of Heaven! :-DBefore we left, I couldn't leave w/o dessert: Red Velvet Cupcake and it was my first time trying their baked \"Kisses\" that some reviewers have been raving about.

The potato balls are good like everyone says, but everything else seems pretty standard to me. Nothing really stands out.The thing I really don't like is the crowds and the setup. This place is APESHIT-busy all the time, there's like 20 different places to stand in line, no one has any idea who's next or where to pay or what the fuck is going on generally, and it's LOUD. Every time I walk in the door, all I can think about is how much I want to get the hell out of there.The quality/appeal of the food doesn't even come close to offsetting the screeching-hell environment inside that place, especially at the times when everyone wants to go, like on a Sunday morning.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Ben L.", "time": "9/16/2015"}, {"content": "I wasn't impressed with there spinach croissant as a croissant should have a flaky crust and a texture that kind of melts in your mouth. The Costco croissant taste better overall. Also the sandwich was nothing to be enthusiastic about as the bread texture was absolutely normal. There wasn't any crunch of flavor to it. The mocha was too sweet as if overtaking the flavor of the actual coffee. But the prices are great so if you want food that looks like this go for it!

The Cuban sandwich is a favorite, after all it is a Cuban restaurant! The bread is so fresh. The fruit empanadas are delightful, The turnovers are an oh so flaky favorite of mine! The Potato balls must be ordered by the dozen (unless you are a rookie and don't understand the process) and the .... well it goes on and on and is too much fun.

We seem to have lost real bakeries and everything is outsourced :-(I had a couple out of this world croquettes and my dad has a \"cheese roll\" which he happily dunked into his coffee, both to his liking.I was unprepared to bring home extra bags, but I assure you, the next time I'm there (& that's at least 3x a year)-you bet I'm gonna be one of those people with multiple bags headed out the door!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Kelly B.", "time": "1/1/2016"}, {"content": "being from Miami area-- this place is HIGHLY over-rated..... sorry Charlie.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Aaron S.", "time": "8/10/2016"}, {"content": "Very high quality sandwiches and some amazing pastry.
