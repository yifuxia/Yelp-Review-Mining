I swear, I heard about this place when I was still in High School (like really, SoCal was world's away, how am I ever going to get my hands on these amazing pastries?). My first encounter with something from Porto's Bakery was the past Thanksgiving when my friend came up and brought a box of potato balls and guava & cheese pastries. Oh my god, they were amazing! The potato balls were even better after microwaving them for like 10 seconds. After this, I had to get my hands on more and that I did.Arriving on a Sunday morning around 9am, I got lucky and found a spot in the parking lot right away. Maybe it was in fact luck, but I also had no trouble waiting in line to place my order. As I approached the counter, I simply told the girl who was helping me that, \"this is my first time here and i'm actually on my way back to the Bay Area. What would you recommend?\" She was really sweet and simply walked me through their best sellers. Of course, I ended up getting a dozen of the potato balls and guava & cheese pastries since I've had them before. She also highly recommended the cheese rolls, which I haven't tried. Even better, she offered me a free sample and handed me an entire roll (talk about great customer service)! I ended up ordering a little more here and there before I was finished with my shopping spree.After filling up 3 boxes, she brings my order to the side counter. Surprisingly, my total only came out to be ~$28! Honestly, I was pretty surprised because I expected it to be around $40 for the amount of stuff I ordered. This was a great experience, I just wish that I didn't write this review this late because I ended up forgetting my server's name :[ I'll definitely be back, a MUST on my way back from SoCal!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Wiseley F.", "time": "3/19/2014"}, {"content": "Anytime I'm down in the LA area, I always make sure to make a stop here at portos. \u00a0This is my 3rd time at this location. \u00a0There is a free parking lot next to it which is very convenient, although it's a tight squeeze in some areas.Angelica helped me out and was patient since I was making a big order and let me tell you...she was good!! \u00a0By chit chatting with her, I found out she opened, and was coming off the end of her shift and STILL as cheery and bubbly as if her day just started. \u00a0Things that I've triedCheese rolls- \u00a0a must! \u00a0Just get it!Potato balls - the first time I tried this, I didn't know what to expect! \u00a0 I was pleasantly surprised since it was Meat pie - i love the pastry/meat combo. \u00a0The pastry has a slight sweet side that gives a good balance to the meat. \u00a0There were some pieces that didn't have much meat, but considering the price- it's ok in my book.Croissant sandwich- I grabbed this since i wanted a quick bite. \u00a0$4.95 and a decent size. \u00a0I had to pick it up at the other side, but to my surprise I didn't have to wait too long for it. \u00a0Tasted good but wouldn't say it had a WOW factor.Overall- Portos scores a 5 in my book. \u00a0Tons of choices, good prices, quick service, and tastes great!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "David F.", "time": "7/13/2015"}, {"content": "Awwww man this place is awesome. For fear of repetition I'll be concise.Turkey Croissant Sandwich (~$4.75?)- best croissant sandwich I've ever had. I'd easily pay double for this mouth watering delight.Tres Leches Cookies with Chocolate filling ($0.50each)- perfect balance of sweet.Plantains: Crunchy, addictive, light and not particularly awesome but easy to eat and I couldn't resist eating mine and my friends. Fruit tart: Tasted like any other fruit tart I've had.Flan: Super sweet and nothing original.Cheese Roll: Flakey, crunchy, moist, buttery, cheesy and delicious. I could easily down 5 of these. And get a box to go.Potato Ball filled w/ meat: I can see it's appeal but I wouldn't order it again. Too many other better options.Overall this is an awesome place to visit. It's loud and crowded so I wouldn't do it often but whenever I have someone out of town visiting I will certainly take them here for the reasonable prices, large variety, and guaranteed satisfaction. I ate so much in one sitting (Yes I ate what I listed above...except I indulged in only 1 cheese roll not 5. I'm not that crazy) \u00a0that I was satiated till night time.

Plus, the seating is much more accommodating than at the original Glendale location.I highly, highly recommend following the restaurant on Facebook because the photos of all the sandwiches, pastries, breads, etc. are absolutely enviable and mouth-watering.

To this location, yes.Ah, Porto's! I make it a point to visit every time I come home and its always just as delicious as the last time. This was my first visit to the Burbank location - it's just as crazy, large, and awesome as the Glendale establishment. There are a lot more options in the case from what I remember; it's hard to choose between your usuals and trying something new...so why not try them all! :) Today I had MY usual - potato balls! These are great fresh from the case, warmed up as leftovers, and even frozen and heated up again. Add your favorite hot sauce (or eat them plain) and you're good to go! My other usual is the guava smoothie which has great guava flavor, but it's not too sweet. Get the large size! I also tried their Southwest salad con bistec. The bistec is tender, flavorful cuts of meat with a slight lemony zest; the salad fresh and dressed with a cilantro vinaigrette. It was a light, but filling dinner option. Lines are always long, but they move fairly quickly. The staff is amazing at memorizing your order and speedy to get it all together for you at the cash register.
