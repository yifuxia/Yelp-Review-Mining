Our FAVORITES are the potato balls, chicken croquet, guava cheese rolls, and mango empanada. My sister and I make a habit to try a different dessert every time we come here lol so far we have tried and love the red velvet cupcake, mango cheesecake, cream puff and fruit tart. We have also tried their turkey croissant sandwich which is also good and my dad always gets their cafe mocha.Despite it being sort of loud and super crazy inside with people ordering, the customer service is awesome! The employees don't ever look annoyed when you order and if a certain bread or dessert isn't presented out on the front, they will check in the kitchen to see if they have anymore = A+ in my book!Definitely recommend this place if you're ever in LA and out of all the food I mentioned, make sure to try the potato balls and guava cheese rolls!!! it's a must ;)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Freida T.", "time": "12/4/2014"}, {"content": "Everything is AMAZING!! \u00a0Much less crowded than the Glendale location. \u00a0The croquettes weren't my favorite but any of the sweet pastries are amazing! \u00a0Give this place a try and take some to go!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lainie A.", "time": "4/2/2016"}, {"content": "Best bakery in town , everything here is awesome , cakes arent sweet like others its like perfect , if u new come check this place out or the other 2 location the have", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jay C.", "time": "1/6/2016"}, {"content": "Besides the lines being ridiculous at times, there selection is vast and delicious in the bakery section!

HOWEVER, an old office mate of mine used to bring us a veritable SMORGASBORD of savory pastries from Porto's every month...and DAMN. Those things are tasty. And they weren't even warm anymore since it would take him an hour to get from Porto's to UCLA. I can't imagine what fresh potato balls from Porto's taste like. I'm drooling just thinking about them. I can't speak to the physical location, but the food is top notch. I try not to eat too much pastry...but if I lived next to Porto's I'd probably become spherical in shape.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Kristin F.", "time": "4/1/2016"}, {"content": "Great place always, no matter how long you have to wait.

It's so good that it's worth the long lines and lack of parking. We've used them for catering as well and for the price and quality they can't be beat. The staff is very efficient and friendly. There's just such a huge demand that it's never busy. I've stopped by at 6:30am and there's already a line.

I went in this morning to order a coffee. Simple.

Got a dozen potato balls with the meat inside (I don't know the actual name for it sorry) they were definitely a must have. The girl who helped me even suggested I get them cool to reheat later so they don't get soggy. I got them hot so I could eat some and they were good later too soggy and all! I also got dulce de leche kisses (the cookies are filled) and they are so amazing! The line was also really long and I hear it's like that daily if not busier on the weekends. We got lucky because our line moved fairly quickly and a table just cleared so we got to sit down at and eat. You can pre order from some signs I saw around too. Porto's is all around an amazing place I would love to come back!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Alex A.", "time": "9/27/2015"}]
