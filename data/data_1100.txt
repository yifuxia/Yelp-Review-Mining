You have to try their potato balls! The Cuban sand which is also great and for dessert they have so many amazing things.

Guava-cheese pastry one of the best things I have ever had: the tartness of the guava jelly sets off the gras of the pastry. Potato balls are great, reminded me of similar dish my Somali friend's mom makes for eid. So Cubano-Somali connection? Lines can be long, but they move very quickly.

What is not to love about this place? From the bakery to the breakfasts, Portos is quality from beginning to end. The Mango Mousse cake and baked ham and cheese croissant are my favorite.

I always get cakes here for birthdays, trust when I say they are the best, not too sweet, moist and beautiful. Staff is always on point, fast, friendly and able to memorize orders as long as my arm.

Their food is some of the best quality I've seen maintained in a bakery setup like they have it. The food is contained properly, kept at the right temperatures and tastes like it was just freshly made every time.My boss brings all sorts of stuff from this bakery to work, and everything I eat (I dont have a lot of different kinds of food eating experience) I eat everything. I'm like wow what am I even eating? I never heard of it. Its delicious. The #1 craziest dessert I never thought I'd ever eat was their raspberry macarons. DUDE. if you're a fan of berries and raspberries, you gotta give it a shot. It's super fresh, the custard is sweet but not overwhelming and the macarons have that amazing balance of gooey but flaky at the same time. Sheer perfection.. so light, sweet and really satisfying if you're into that kind of flavor.I gotta come back and try everything. It is now my life mission.
