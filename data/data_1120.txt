Great bakery, their desserts,especially their dulce de leche napoleon (my favorite) and the mango cheesecake are just right,not too sweet. I usually get the torta de Pollo sandwich, but the Cubano is good as well.The mariquitas (platain chips) that come with sandwiches are usually nice and crunchy. The papas (meat filling) rellenas are great. We had the seafood (shrimp filling) balls as well, since they only have them around easter time. I prefer the meat ones over the seafood ones. The smoothies are delicious, my favorites are their horchata and mango smoothies.

The lines are long, but it's worth the wait. The true test of a great bakery is the quality of its cupcakes and I went for a Parisian Cupcake with some worry I'd get a mouthful of too much oil or butter or sugar. My friends? The topping on the Parisian Cupcake is chocolate mousse. I am swooning. The prices are outstanding for the quality of product and the amount of people employed, who are all somehow hugely friendly in spite of the crush of customers. When I first visited, one of the employees slipped me a dulce de leche pastry since I only wanted one of the small cookies, and even though the caramel was too sweet for me, I absolutely insist Porto's come up with an easier way to tip their employees.
