I was so happy when I moved to Toluca Lake because I would be near a Porto's. \u00a0I used to go to the Glendale location but now the Burbank location is only 2 miles away from me. \u00a0I love Portos' pastries and I will wait in their long lines for the delicious goodness that is their dulce de leche kisses and their huge cheap chocolate croissants. \u00a0So when it came time to order a custom cake for a coworker, I confidently told my boss I would take care of it and get it from Portos because their cakes were bound to be so yummy. I regret doing so. First, I called Portos and told them I would need a simple white cake with a cute happy design \u00a0(like a rainbow or balloons) and writing. \u00a0We had a very special message for my coworker that needed to be on there for the cake to work. \u00a0They told me I had to come in to order that cake and that I had to ask for a \"custom\" cake. \u00a0I asked why i couldn't just use one of their sheet cakes that they have on display and get writing on it but the lady insisted that what I was talking about was a \"custom\" cake. \u00a0Then, I went into order the cake - showing the lady I ordered the cake from a picture of the type of cake I wanted - letting her know I wanted the writing to be big and visible and in capital black letters becasue that was the important part of the cake. \u00a0I showed her a little rainbow on the corner of the cake that I wanted and she said, they couldn't \"customize\" the cake like that and I would need to choose a preset one within a book that they had. \u00a0I told her again that I did not care about what design the cake was but really I wanted something light and colorful with the writing in it. \u00a0She chose a design for me that was blue with clouds and cute, and told me and I paid $35 for the cake. \u00a0We wrote down that the writing needed to be big and bold and capitalized and central to the cake. \u00a0I went in this morning and guess what? \u00a0They told me that the writing wouldn't fit onto the cake because of the clouds and because I ordered a cake that was too small. \u00a0I TOLD the lady that I would pay whatever to get the writing on the cake. \u00a0I paid MORE for a custom cake so I could get the writing on the cake and now I was being told that the ONE thing I needed on the cake (The Writing) - they could not do for me. \u00a0I asked them why I couldn't just get a sheet white dulce de leche sheet cake they had for sale (like I wanted in the first place) and they couldn't write on that cake the letters for me and the guy told me, then that isn't a custom cake - you can come in and ask for that any time! \u00a0WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? \u00a0They eventually fixed it for me by wiping the clouds away and putting the lettering on the cake but I had to wait 20 minutes to get it, was late to work, and my coworker beat me to work with no cake waiting for him (which was the whole point.) \u00a0So Portos - your pastries are delicious and your workers are generally nice but your cake service was incredibly disappointing. \u00a0I will never be ordering another cake from you again.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Karen S.", "time": "9/30/2015"}, {"content": "First off.. to all you folks out there..

Two dozen? :) \u00a0I can always eat them the next day, or share it with my family. \u00a0The cheese rolls are a must. \u00a0Especially warm, they are nice and custardy inside with a sugary, flakey exterior. \u00a0This savory yet sweet pastry shouldn't be dismissed.If you remember back from my Porto's Bakery Glendale blog post, I wasn't a real fan of the potato balls. Granted, I will never eat them one after another (like the cheese rolls) -- they are more enjoyable this time. \u00a0They grew on me, or I was hungry that day -- either way, I enjoyed them. \u00a0I even ordered the meat pies out of impulse and as a safety net of the potato balls. \u00a0The dough was chewy and meaty on the inside, flakey on the outside. There is hope for these meat filled goodies I guess.Porto's is a must visit wherever you are. \u00a0They have pastries and sandwiches for savory or sweet lovers. \u00a0The Burbank location was a lot more roomy and less chaotic than the one in Glendale (at least that day). \u00a0Two lines helped the crowds disperse and have everyone going happy with their boxes of treats. \u00a0After trying the Glendale and Burbank locations, I can only imagine what Downy has to offer.
