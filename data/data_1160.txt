There were Sooo many treat options! Ah! I want to try everything! Since it was early I decided on a butter croissant and a medium (huge) cup of coffee. My sister ordered a pumpkin muffin and a medium coffee as well. Our total was only $6! Crazy! All of the staff was really nice and helpful. They were very busy, but organized, so the line went by fast. When I walked up to the coffee counter to get my coffees he made them for me right away!

I was like okay then...but let me tell you it was definitely worth the wait! Also the service is amazing. I only waited for about 10-15 minutes. I do have to say they should have more seats...but besides that it was good.  \u00a0 The pasties were delicious, I definitely recommend the potato balls and the cheese rolls. They tasted perfect! And I'm not exaggerating I literally fell in love. Another thing is their smoothies are yummy as well, the guava smoothie tasted fresh and delightful.  \u00a0 I will defiantly have to come here again.

There are so many other great options to try out. BUT, cheese rolls remain number ONE on my list. I walked into the bakery and was immediately awed by the large display case of delicious-looking goodies. The line was pretty long, and I thought to myself, \"Ok, I've got time to figure out what I want.\" But, the workers were so quick and efficient that before I knew it I'm already being asked for my order. My friend who lives in Burbank was with me and suggested potato balls, guava cheese strudels, and cheese rolls. He made it sound like the potato balls are better than the cheese rolls. So, I ordered more potato balls than cheese rolls. The potato balls took me by surprise, in a good way. I was just expecting potato, but there were actually meat in there which just brought them to a whole another level. Love how it's crispy on the outside and the inside, sooo soft. The guava cheese strudel were deletable as well, but for me, it just wasn't guava-ey (I just made up a word lol) enough. Those cheese rolls though.... they're not just cheese rolled in dough. I can't find the right words to describe them. They're just something else, they're out of this world even. They're sweet but not too sweet. They're flaky, crispy, and soft at the same time. After one bite, you just want more and wish you had an unlimited supply of these bad boys.NOT ordering more cheese rolls is one of my biggest regrets. \u00a0I wouldn't be so sad about it if I didn't live all the way in Hawaii. It's not like I can just take a drive. I'd have to fly over the pacific ocean to get me some more of these cheese rolls.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Heather S.", "time": "10/28/2014"}, {"content": "My boyfriend and I were absolutely floored by how fantastic and cheap everything was.
