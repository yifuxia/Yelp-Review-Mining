Well, I could add a lot of personal stories about how and why I ended up at Porto's on this particular day or that one and yada yada yada.Nah, I'll just add my positive experiences to the list and do what you will with it. And by do what you will, I mean go there and eat their food. Because it's good. Really good. I will start in an unlikely area, salads. Probably not the first thing that comes to mind when Porto's is mentioned. But the salads are actually fantastic! They are unique to them and have very light and tangy dressings which make them just perfect IMO. Next I'd like to offer my accolades to them for having such a well oiled machine. Although the lines can be long, they move quickly and efficiently and let's face it, we need that time to stare at everything and figure out what we want. Am I right?And by the way.......clever Porto's...... very clever indeed how an entire dozen of guava cheese pastries costs a mere $7 or so. Now I HAVE to get a whole dozen. And I don't even like sweets (that much;) Those guava sweet & savory situations are mighty good though. I always get birthday cakes from Porto's. They have a special line for whole cakes and you're in, you're out! The cakes are beautiful and delicious. They customize them with a white chocolate plaque and chocolate writing. They're very grown up and classy looking. For my 3year olds bday I got a chocolate one, put some toy dump trucks and tractors on it and he was psyched. It was really cute and everyone was happy to make it disappear.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Elexa N.", "time": "10/5/2014"}, {"content": "Porto's never disappoints. \u00a0I was craving a media noche sandwich following my errands on Saturday to prep for my Super Bowl party. \u00a0It came as no surprise that the place was packed. \u00a0But the line moved quickly, and the staff was super friendly as always. \u00a0As I was waiting at the pick up counter for my sandwich, I looked down at my receipt and noticed that my sandwich wasn't on there. \u00a0It was the first thing I ordered, and I repeated it to the gal helping me about 10 times. \u00a0I asked the manager about the fact that my sandwich wasn't on the order, and was I correct to assume that there would be no sandwich coming because of that. \u00a0She looked at my receipt, said she would take care of it, and within a few short minutes I had my sandwich. \u00a0She didn't even charge me!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Laura S.", "time": "2/13/2016"}, {"content": "See the line out the door?

I couldn't believe how delicious the dishes were, and how BIG they are for under $7. While waiting in line, we did our best not to get any sweets (good luck with that! We most definitely missed out for that decision). The cakes looked absolutely amazing, as did the endless selection of desserts).

I always get a dozen of each since their prices are incredible! Customer service is outstanding! They're the best at providing prompt service since they do have A LOT of foot traffic. You will never see a slacker working here, only hardworking people, management is certainly doing a great job at this.
