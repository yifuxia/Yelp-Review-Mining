The line is crazy, any day and time of the week, but it's worth the wait. Their feta and cheese puff pastries are amazing, their cheese puffs are just unforgettable, their salads are Great, coffee is yummy... I just cannot tell you how much I love this place. Oh and you have to try their potato balls... They are just wonderful. \u00a0The one thing that sucks is the parking and the amount of time you have to wait to get your food.

I frequent the Burbank location and it has friendly service, delicious items and many choices to choose from. My faves are the cuban sandwiches, cheese rolls, chocolate croissants, coffee cake and their parisian cake.They make customize cakes, however when I had my daughter's graduation cake specially made using her gradiation photo. It did not transfer correctly and it was not done correctly. Instead of letting me know beforehand they tried to sell me the cake anyway upon pickup. I was not too pleased to say the least. They did try to copy and transfer the photo unto the cake again while I waited over an hour. Once that was not going to work they had to redesign it accordingly and it came out beautiful. So all in all they will definitely try their best to accommodate their customers, so let them know if you are not happy. Parking at this location gets very busy so beware. Their pricing is very reasonable , they offer catering options, and you can call in your orders as well.Porto's Bakery is a great lunch spot and you will enjoy all of their cuban creations!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Leese V.", "time": "12/18/2014"}, {"content": "There is never a bad thing that comes out of portos.

There was barely any actual cake and whatever cake there was, was dry. Nobody likes a mouthful of frosting. Barely had any pina colada mousse and for what I paid it just wasn't worth it.

We also got an iced caf\u00e9 con leche and an iced white chocolate mocha. These beverages were prepared with love and care, let me tell you! The breakfast sandwich was outstanding.

I buy one or two (or three or four :P) every time I come here, and add a bunch of others too. The prices are very reasonable for what you get.

When I visit Porto's, there's usually a long line - sometimes even out the door! - but the staff is efficient and friendly and the line usually goes by quickly.The last time I was here, I tried the Cubano sandwich. It was served nice and hot and it was really, really good - but my friend said it used to come with potato balls mashed up into it, which it didn't have this time, so that part was a little disappointing.

I live in SoCal and finally went here for the first (and second) time this past month. The lines are generally extremely long and it takes at least 30 mins to get through the line.

We stopped by early at around and grabbed breakfast before heading out to Palm Springs. Porto's is already bustling with people getting sheet cakes for their parties. Here is the deal: Get in line, decide what you're gonna have for speedy service. If you're only buying a cake, you can get into the express line. We had a guava pastry (.90), a cheese roll (.90), and a ham & egg omelet croissant ($3.7). The croissant sandwich was made to order, with generous portion of diced ham on a airy, flaky croissant cut in halves. It was a hearty breakfast. The attendant who took my order gave me a potato ball to try when he could tell I haven't never had one. I also love their savory cuban sandwich, which came with plantain chips.We also grabbed a pineapple/coconut cake with us to be taken to the boys party in Palm Springs. They were gone in no time after being cut. The chocolate black forest is my favorite.
