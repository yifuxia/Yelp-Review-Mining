But some of the must try's are the guava cheese pastries, chocolate layered cake, tres leches, and the fruit tart. I love everything there but these are the stand outs in my opinion.

All of the pastries, sandwiches, and drinks are at a very reasonable price. And the quality is Amazing. Get the Caprese sandwich. It's perfect for this summer weather.

I've never even heard of the place so had to check it out on Yelp. Around 3000 reviews and so many rave reviews. Walked in to find a roped off area for a line and a worker instructing how many could go in. I was getting the feeling I was in line at an amusement park. Crazy right?Lets get to the nitty gritty. Do ask for samples. They will give you a WHOLE one to try and as many samples as you want.Prices are AMAZING!!! 1/3 of what a comparable bakery would usually charge. For example: huge delicious chocolate croissant is almost $4 in a french bakery in palo alto. Here its $1.60. You get the gist.If you like mash tators and anything fried. . You've found the mother load. Potato balls. Ground meat surrounded by mash potatoes then rolled in panko and fried. Guava and cheese pastry... yes! So many to choose from. Cakes, \u00a0fruit tarts, pastries galore, fresh squeezed OJ, sandwiches, salads. Its the freaking disneyland of bakeries.

The cheese rolls are infamous and I love the guava cheese roll and of course the chocolate croissant...and their oreo smoothie...and their chai lattes..and their coffee...okay I basically like everything. This place gets real crowded and that may drive people away, but Porto's was build for crowds and the staff handles the long lines with speed and great service!

I had always noticed how busy it is when driving by and I've tried the infamous potato balls a couple times at catered events. I now completely understand why this place is packed. Delicious and AMAZING prices. I didn't believe the prices at first. There is a small parking lot behind the restaurant but there's also lots of street parking. It's always busy and crowded in here so don't expect a quiet surrounding. You are directed into a line that leads you to the display full of an array of different pastries and cakes. There's also a menu on the wall behind the counter with menu items like coffee/tea, sandwiches, salads, etc. Once you get to the front of the line, you order at the counter and they give you a number (if you're eating there). From there, you find your own seating and there's a decent amount of seating options. I ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich on a wheat round and an iced chai tea latte. My boyfriend ordered the Cubano. We also decided to order a couple pastry and dessert items, a couple potato balls (obviously), a small chorizo pie, a small fruit tart and a dulce de leche mini bundt cake. Potato balls were incredible and only $0.89 each. The chorizo pie was a little doughy for our tastes. We both loved our sandwiches which were served with plantain chips. The sandwiches were $7, which is a total deal. We ate the desserts later in the day since we were so stuffed. Unfortunately the desserts were less impressive than the lunch we ate. The bundt cake was a little dry and the fruit tart was okay, I've had better. Next time, we're going to try a slice of the carrot cake and a creme brulee!
