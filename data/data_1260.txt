The cheese guava pastry also hit the spot. Got both for $3.70 TOTAL. WHAT A DEAL.Definitely hands down 5/5. Lines are a bit long but it's SO worth it.

Ehh..2) chicken croquette (4/5) - 90 cents - CHICKEN potato ball haha. instead of the ground beef. \u00a0This was better, more flavor. 3) cheese roll (3/5) - everyone raves about this but it was just too sweet and cheesy for me. \u00a0My bf liked it, so its up to you 4) Cuban sandwich & midnight sandwich (3/5) - ~$4.50 - we recently went on a trip to Seattle for their Cuban sandwiches and were still craving it, but sadly, it didn't not compare :( OVERALL: Went, tried, over it.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Raquel Y.", "time": "7/25/2013"}, {"content": "What can I say? This is Porto's. With almost 4,000 reviews so far, there's nothing new I can saw about this spot. I can only say what I appreciate the most about it.Porto's theme is consistent and true. It actually intimidated me the first time I walked by. I though, \"man, I can't afford this place.\" It looks classy! But, it's cheap!! The bakery has everything; sandwiches, coffee, smoothies and the best of all, pastries. The pastries...The pastries are killer. Completely affordable and wonderful all at the same time. It doesn't make any sense but I love it!It seems everyone in Burbank goes to this place for breakfast and lunch. Who wouldn't? Right now, I'm trying the Strawberry-Banana All Natural Smoothie. It hits the spot and only costs $3.39 for a standard size. If you're looking for something really healthy yet orgasmic in the mouth, I recommend the Portos Veggie sandwich.

Today I had my fresh squeezed orange juice by the way the machine looks very cool. We had the cubano and the Italian sub both incredibly delicious. The subs are served with a small side of crispy banana chips delicious. Pastries everything I've tried is good cheese rolls, muffins, newyork cheese cake.

I kept seeing pictures of the food from Porto's and hearing how amazing it was. I thought it was probably just overhyped and not really as good as everyone said it was.. but boy was I wrong. The food here was FANTASTIC. In order of my favorites:1. Meat Pie - loved the crust and the flavor of the meat was just soo good!2. Cheese Roll - I don't even like cheese that much but the cheese rolls are deliciouss. Not SUPER cheesy or strongly flavored. 3. Chicken Empanada - Mmm more tasty meat! There was more meat than the meat pie but I didn't like this crust as much. Still super good though!4. Potato Ball - I like potatoes haha so the potato ball was yummy to me. 5. Guava & Cheese Strudel - I'm not a huge fan of fruit jams/jellies so that's probably why I didn't like this as much as other people.Usually I like sweet over savory so I was pretty surprised I liked the savory food more! Everything was just made perfectly and had the right texture and flavors. And you can't beat the price! It's so cheap! The service here is very efficient too.
