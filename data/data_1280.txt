Display upon display of sweet and savory goodies. Not to mention, they also have a bfast and lunch menu which I'll have to try later. BUT OMG THE PASTRIES ARE HI QUALITY AND CHEAP. I understand the hype now and I'm glad to give Porto's my money. *** = MUST GET ***CHEESE ROLLS--just found out that it's not cheese but cream cheese. Anywho, it's an AMAZING and simple pastry that will pair well with any type of beverage. Don't be fooled by the \"cheese\" in the name! They should be renamed to FLAKY DOUGHY GOODNESS ROLLS--GUAVA CHEESE DANISH--I'm usually not a fan of a guava-cheese combo but decided to give this one a shot just in case. The cheese was too tart imo but I think it's supposed to be that way to offset the intense richness from the guava ***PINEAPPLE CHEESE DANISH--up an amp from the cheese danish and just as good, if not, a bit better. the pineapple adds just a tad more sweetness but balances well with the cheeseELEPHANT EAR--these used to be wonderful and flaky but now they're overcooked. The sugar is has become an overly sweet and hard rock candy and the pastry is way too crisp :[STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE--good but definitely missing a wow factor. CARROT CAKE--delicious and rich cinnamon-y and carrot-y goodness. ***POTATO BALLS: POPEYES MASH POTATOES in ball form. HAM CROQUETTE: weird pasty and sticky consistency. flavor profile is pretty neutral besides some slight saltiness from the ham but nothing special. CHICKEN CROQUETTE: weird pasty and sticky consistency. the chicken was kinda dry and didn't contribute much in terms of flavor. ***MEAT PIE: buttery, flaky, stuffed to perfection with bits of meat. OMG I CAN EAT THIS ALL DAY LONG***CHORIZO EMPANADA: same pastry shell as the meat pie but the chorizo was so flavorful. it's like a less JUICY SALTENA. CHICKEN EMPANADA: get the chorizo one. ***FANCY EGG BREAD: subtly sweet and squishy bread! \u00a0SPINACH FETA CROISSANT: great savory croissantSUGAR CROISSANT: i should have ordered the regular butter croissant. this was glazed with sugar and had little sugar rocks sprinkled on top. overload.

It's kind of hard to find a good parking spot and because this place is so popular, parking lots get full pretty fast! There is also a line that ends outside. Once you get in, (which usually doesn't take too long), you just admire the atmosphere/setting of this place. Very pretty with beautiful chandeliers.

I split it with the boyfriend, it was a bit too much for me, however still amazing! 2. coconut ball, has a thin outside layer of sugar and then all coconut in the middle. Again this one I could only eat about half.3. finally I had the mango empanada, which was very good! I love anything that has fruit in it. Not too sweet at all. As far as the sandwiches go;1. Steak Torta, which I think was my favorite. It is only $6.70 and full of yummy goodness! Strips of grilled steak, black bean spread, guacamole, cotija cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, on a French round. Served after 10 am.2. Pan con lechon (Roasted pork sandwich): $4.99 This was a simple yet good sandwich. The meat was good, not dry which was nice. It reminded me of a roast beef dip sandwich, but better!

I've had red velvet, tiramisu, mango mousse, raspberry mouse, fruit tart, and cheesecake. All of them were wonderful. If I were forced to single out one, I would probably pick the mango mousse because it's harder to find good mango mousse cake elsewhere in the area (whereas tons of bakeries offer red velvet).PASTRIES: Guava cheese pastry & mango empanada. The mini cakes/individual slices are also a solid option.SANDWICHES: Medianoche & the potato ball sandwiches.

The fact that I don't eat meat also prevents me from enjoying some of their popular meat offerings. I'm not crazy about super rich and flaky pastries with a lot of butter, so maybe that's why, lol.
