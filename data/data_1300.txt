[{"content": "Porto's is the BEST!!!! It doesn't get better than this, especially for the amazing food you're getting for an amazing low price compared to other bakeries & sandwich shops that are just overpriced and not even close as good as the the quality & freshness that Porto's brings to the table. Favorites are the potato balls, meat pies, pork tamales, cherry & pineapple danish, the CUBAN sandwich (is a must), the italian sandwich (amazing, trust me, I'm from Philly...I've had my fair share of amazing italian sandwiches and the Porto's version is worthy!), the dinner plates, and so many other things. I could go on and on...It would probably take me 20 years to try everything on Porto's amazing selection & variety. If you're in Burbank or in LA, THIS IS A MUST. P.S. Don't get discouraged by the long lines. They go by faster than you think and they're also good training for disneyland :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Chogrin M.", "time": "8/2/2015"}, {"content": "If you have a sweet tooth this is the place for you.

Plus, the price is extremely affordable. Fortunately, well, and unfortunately for that matter, because of the crowd, I rarely want to come to this place. With that being said, I still highly recommend you come here for a visit, get your insulin shots ready, and enjoy~", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Eric C.", "time": "7/27/2014"}, {"content": "Best bakery in Burbank. \u00a0Prepare yourself for the long lines, but worth the wait.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Louise A.", "time": "7/21/2016"}, {"content": "I took my 17 month old daughter for a late afternoon snack. \u00a0It was our first father daughter date and we had a great time. \u00a0My daughter had one potato ball. \u00a0The potato was tasty and she almost finished one whole one. \u00a0I got a brownie and chocolate chip cookie. \u00a0It was fresh and yummy. \u00a0She shared an ice water with lots of ice. \u00a0We will definitely be returning soon!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Ernie C.", "time": "7/21/2016"}, {"content": "The lines are so ridiculous.
