(good sign!)The restaurant was so clean and the employees looked like they were on a mission.The customer service here was friendly, fast, and extremely attentive.The lady who helped us memorized our order and each of the specifics of our dishes, I was impressed!!I tried the potato-cheese balls and they were SO delicious-- I could probably eat them by the dozen. They had four types of cheeses: parmesan, ricotta, and two others I'm forgetting.There was plenty of seating for us and I was so impressed that Porto's Burbank had a parking lot for their customers. Now that is true accommodation!! Bravo.We ordered:The dinner plate (beans, rice, fried plantains and shredded pork)The chicken empanadaThe steak tortaDulce de luche Napoleon Fruit tart The dinner plate was such a nice assortment and extremely well seasoned and flavorful. The pork was some of the best we've ever had.The rice was soft and perfectly cooked. The beans were also so very fresh. The fried plantains were just an added bonus that added more WOW to the plate.The chicken empanada was okay. The filling was delicious and flavorful but I was not a fan of the crust.The steak torta sandwich was so delicious! Meat cooked perfectly and pairs well with everything on the sandwich: beans, guac, tomato, and cotija cheese! It came with plantain chips which were delicious and very unique compared to the standard potato chip.The dulche de leche napoleon proved to me that yes, there will be good food in heaven if it is this delicious on Earth. HIGHLY recommend the Dulche De Leche Napoleon. It's fluffy, caramel-ly and everything nice.The fruit tart was nice and very fresh too!!The wait for the food flew by and the wait in line was perfect timing considering we needed to decide which of all the delicious dishes to order.I will be returning to Porto's soon and only wish they were located everywhere in California.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Megan S.", "time": "8/24/2015"}, {"content": "Great food and pastries.
