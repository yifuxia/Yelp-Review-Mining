[{"content": "This review is incredibly overdue... but here it goes. I visited the restaurant portion and ordered a ropa vieja sandwich. It comes with a side of plantain chips. Much to my surprise, I was very unimpressed. For one, it was difficult to find a table and once we secured one, nobody was available to clean it. It actually didn't get wiped down at all. It was a long wait until our food came out and when it did, the sandwich was completely cold and the bread was getting hard (it is not a cold cut sandwich, it should have been served warm). I was underwhelmed by the taste but it is hard to say if I was just not into it because it was cold. Due to that one experience and the not so affordable prices I will likely not be eating there again. Fortunately, the bakery makes up for all my heartbreak from the restaurant. I've had custom cakes ordered and not only are their prices very fair but they do incredibly beautiful custom decorated work with no compromise in the delicate taste of the cakes with only a few weeks of advance notice. I've ordered custom tres leches and Cuban pineapple cakes and both were absolutely delicious and memorable. I've also purchased their premade cakes and again, such a wonderful experience and needless to say, I will never buy a cake at a grocery store when for the same amount I can buy a beautiful and delicious one at Portos. The consistency of delivering a beautiful and tasty product is there 100%. Of course, I've had their potato balls and meat pies from the bakery as well and again, they were a home run. The lines are always insane but it is well warranted. They end is moving quickly and customer service is good despite the constant rush of people.

From the Napoleon dessert to the cheese meat balls to their coffee, can't get any better. Also, they are supper organized.

Overall a bakery with yummy pastries. \u00a0A lot of other reviews and later my friend told me next time to get the meat pie which is like a vietnamese meat puff pastry item usually at sandwich shops (Bate So). \u00a0I will definitely do this when I'm at the store able to make the purchase and not when I know the food would be in the car ride and not back until the next morning.If you I'm ever down south in the area, I definitely would go back.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Linda P.", "time": "10/5/2014"}, {"content": "If you're in the Burbank area it's definitely worth the trip to stop here and try their food. It's really good. This is one of my favorite places to go. If you eat inside the place they will give you free plantain chips with your sandwich. However it does get really crowded during lunchtime and dinner time hours so the best time to go is weekdays just before lunchtime and the dinnertime rush. The only thing I don't like about this place is the parking lot it's a one-way and if it's crowded it usually takes forever to park.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Caitlin U.", "time": "4/6/2015"}]
