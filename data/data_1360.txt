[{"content": "First tried this place when my friend brought some of their potato balls back. I thought they were pretty good and they weren't even fresh, so I was pretty excited to finally come here on a recent trip. Of everything I ordered, the meat pie and the cheese rolls are definitely the best! I regret not ordering a dozen of the cheese rolls. I also wanted to try one of their cakes so I ordered a rum soaked sponge cake, but I wasn't really a fan of that because it was way too sweet. Next time I would just stick with the pastries because those were amazing!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Amanda R.", "time": "6/7/2015"}, {"content": "Cheese rolls, empanadas, Medianoche, Cubano, potato balls, their bakery items... it's all so good.

They always have the best food. When you're tired of \u00a0having burgers and fries, go check out Porto's. I have so many favorites here. They have a large variety of delicious food in their menu. The turkey croissant sandwich is served with their homemade plantain chips that are nice and crunchy. Their meat pies, rellenito and potato balls are small and a perfect little treat.

The meat tasted weird and the meat pie barely had any meat in it, although it tasted OK.

There's only three branches and all are in LOs Angeles, none in the Bay Area.Whenever we visit LA to go to universal studios and to see family and extended family, we have to stop by at portos to hoard goodies to bring back home. My mom's favorite are their dulce de leche cookies, my kids favorite are the tres leeches cake and the cheese rolls. I tried this morning their dulce de leche latte and it was really good, on the other hand my husband's cappuccino contains only half amount of coffee in a large cup. No Bueno. The cashier today was kinda snob and didn't bother to assist me when I asked if I can get my sandwich order that is sitting next to him, instead of assisting he ignored me, I mean seriously how is it so difficult to hand me the sandwiches that is only few inches away from you. The person who took my orders was very helpful though. The ham and cheese bread is always missing whenever I want some, we also ordered the potato balls before but decided not to get some today since the last time we had it the taste was not that great, maybe for other people it was good but we thought it was kinda bland. Over all portos is still our favorite bakery in LA, today we get to try the flan and I'm expecting it to be really good. :) see you next time portos.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lyn W.", "time": "7/11/2015"}, {"content": "I love this place!PROS:+ Interior = gorgeous, nice white walls and ceilings with modern lights (semi-chandelier but without the jewels)+ Great selection of menu items+ Long lines that move swiftly and efficiently+ FREE PARKING if you know where (2 hours max on certain days/areas)CONS:- Parking is a pain in the ass- Too many people but I guess that means this place is doing something right :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jaime W.", "time": "4/2/2015"}, {"content": "It's Porto's.
