[{"content": "Pastries and cakes are good - love that there is so much variety to chose from. I think it's a little overrated though for what it is... you've had one potato ball, you've had them all. Maybe I've had my share of them and no longer crave them like I used to. Sandwiches are good and come with a side of plantains. What I don't like about eating here is waiting in a long-ass line and then having to look for a table.

I think I should be honest and admit I love potatoes and probably am hyping them up just a TAAAD. But even if you aren't a potato LOVER, these are still pretty dang good. This bakery is pastry heaven to anyone else who loves sweets and doesn't just go for potato balls. They also offer lunch and sandwiches and last time I got their cuban sandwich, really good! SO MANY OPTIONS. It's overwhelming. You'll find something there because they have soo many things to choose from!Only downside is the line, but then...the upside is that the line moves verrry quickly!! Most people know what they are ordering already so even if you see the line out the door, don't be discouraged and pass up the opportunity!

Service is fast, the sandwiches are delicious, and the cakes are the best made cakes in town. I ordered my favorites, a Medianoche sandwich and a couple Guava Strudels for dinner. My sandwich was delicious. I love the sweet bread, because it make this sandwich taste better than the Cuban Sandwich. The two sandwiches have the same filling; however the difference is the Medianoche has sweet bread and the Cuban Sandwich has just a plain roll. Their signature pastry, the Guava Strudel, is still the best; a sweet guava filling and a super flaky crust. \u00a0I love Portos Bakery.

I have nothing negative to say about this place. It's busy most of the times, but the staff is super efficient of taking care of the customers. The lines move at a good pace. There is a parking lot behind the bakery, which I appreciate a lot so I don't have to drive around looking for parking. It does gets filled though, but I have always managed to find a spot. And coming from LA where you \u00a0have to pay for parking or get it valet, it's nice to not have to do that! Anyways- back to Portos. GET THEIR POTATO BALLS. Best thing you'll ever eat. Seasoned beef + mashed potato + deep fried. Perfect at room temp or piping hot. Your friends will all love you. Their cakes are super affordable! An 8-9\" specialty cake is around $20- say WHAT?!

Good thing they don't have this venue in my city or I'll be a fatty. \u00a0It's quite a trek to get a piece of Porto's. Plan to give yourself a good hour to find parking and then be prepared to wait in line to get your yummy goodness. The line is very similar to Disneyland - the kind that loops around once or twice. However, a fast pass is not needed for this venue coz the line goes pretty fast. When it is your turn, you get one person to cater to your every pastry needs. They come with a huge box eagerly awaiting for you to point at or name any pastry your eyes & tummy desires. The box looks intimidating (coz you fee you'll only buy one or two pastries, but trust me... you won't. You may even fill two or three boxes). Did I mention the pastries are very inexpensive. Forget the $5 cupcakes at those cupcakeries - head to Porto's for the best baked goods! TIP: This venue has two lines (one for sandwiches and one for pastries). Opt to go to the pastry line first coz ya can order your sandwich there, too. I just saved you 15-20 minutes. =)Parking tip: Park in the adjacent lots behind the actual building. There are also street parking - great for burning off the extra calories you'll be consuming shortly.The sandwiches and salads here are also very scrumptious. You really can't visit Porto's and be disappointed.

Flaky and sugary pastry filled with cream cheese.

The ham croquette and potato ball are very filling.Their cakes and other desserts look so yummy. My friend got a birthday cake from here and I believe it was the checkers cake. It was good. \u00a0The prices aren't too bad either. Less than $1 for a cheese roll, about $25 for a cake.Tips: if you can, avoid going here on a Sunday (it's buuussssyyy).
