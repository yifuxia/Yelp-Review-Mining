[{"content": "Every time I'm in Cali I swing by Porto's and pick up some delicious pastries to go. Rosa Porto opened her first bakery on Sunset Blvd in 1976 after her family emigrated here from Cuba. Today there are three locations and long lines out the door everyday. It doesn't stop people from picking up box of cheese rolls, potato balls or a cake. In addition to the pastries, they have some amazing sandwiches, juices and a full cafe. Some of my personal favorites I pick up are empanadas, ham croquettes, meat pies, and of course the potato balls (try the spicy one). You also can't go wrong with any of the danishes or croissants either.

And Porto's is definitely one of them.My boyfriend took me here to try their Potato Balls and Cheese Rolls. No doubt - they were DELICIOUS. The Potato Balls were hot and soft. But it's not just potato - it also has some meat in it. When you pull it apart, you can see the steam rising from the inside and smell the deliciousness. The Cheese Rolls were sweet and yummy as well.BUT my favorites were the Chicken Croquette and the SPICY Potato Ball (boyfriend says the spicy ones are new). These two completely stole the show from the other two. The Chicken Croquette was hot and not dry at all - which tends to be the case with a lot of savory pastries. It's like a mini on-the-go chicken pot pie, but yummier than a chicken pot pie. The Spicy Potato Ball was steaming hot and cheese was bursting out after I took a bite.I was somewhat overwhelmed by the two lines for Pastries and Bakery but it seems the Bakery is more like larger cakes and things while the Pastries line on your left is where you wanna go for quick bites and sweets. But despite the long lines, we ordered fairly quickly and luckily, found a table in the corner. And they have this uncanny Porto's magical ability to find a customer and serve food in a room full of people and no table markers? I'm not too sure how they do it and we didn't stick around to find out so it's now the magic of Porto's...", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Athena C.", "time": "6/22/2016"}, {"content": "Those cheese rolls.... damn!Need I say more?Ok, I guess I can. In Chicago, most supermarkets sell an amazing cheesecake. (Well, \"cheesecake.\" It's technically Cheese Danish Coffee Cake.) Safeway and a couple other stores in California carry it, but it's a far cry from what I get in the Midwest. i.e. it has nothing to do with it. The cheese roll from Porto's came pretty darn close, with the exception of the sugary top layer. (CDCC is less sweet.)The smell was spot-on, and that was good enough for me. The top layers are made of flaky buttery goodness with granulated sugar, which I could have done without, but it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.Good stuff!

What continues to astound me after all these years is the QUALITY of the food for the PRICE! You can't find it or beat it ANYWHERE. Try everything, you won't be disappointed.

I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. I've been enjoying Porto's for years, but never made it inside the actual restaurant. I've always had co-workers pick up the beautiful light yellow pastry boxes and bring them to the office or events. I had some time to kill before picking up my mom from the airport, so my boyfriend and I stopped inside. HE had even bee inside before and doesn't even live in la yet.We got there Sunday of 4th of July weekend around 11:30am and there was a line, but it moved quickly. Honestly, they are pretty good at holding the line so it doesn't get overly crowded inside. They have two sections where you can order from and they both have the same items. In the middle is the drink bar. They were handing out samples of their smoothies which was also really nice. I will say, a small argument broke out during the time in line with two of the customers, but in the end it was fine.I believe we waited in like for about 10 minutes or less, which wasn't bad. Favorites:4 cheese and pepper balls (similar to the potato balls but no meat)gauava and cheese barscheese rollsstrawberry pina colada smoothieParking seemed a little crazy in the lot, so we found street parking in the residential area behind the building.All in all, it was a great experience.

Take that as an opportunity to oogle the glass cases full of delectable pastries, turnovers, donuts, croquettes, cookies, pies, cakes, and treats all made with an Cuban bakers fabulous touch. For breakfast, try the egg and chorizo sandwich, oozing with spicy flavors. Or, the potato balls, a deep fried mash potato and ground meat ball. Or, the chicken croquette -- a crunchy deep fried outer crust surrounding a creamy chicken mixture. I could eat five of these easily! For lunch, the turkey croissant sandwich was simple and satisfying, and served with fried plantains that were crisp not too sweet or oily. Ah-mazing.Sweet lovers may enjoy the guava strudel, layers of flaky dough surrounding a tart guava filling. Or, one of the many gorgeously presented desserts.

The workers are all friendly and move on their feet. The second big reason is of course, their dessert which I love to critique. As a baker, I often eat different variety of desserts and coming here I didn't want to eat something I could make myself. The cakes they have here not only look the part but tastes amazing too. Best of all, it's not overly sweet and doesn't give me that cringing feeling when I bite into cakes from most bakeries. Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try as much items as I can. I ended up leaving the bakery with a box of a dozen guava & cheese pastries, 3 potato balls, 3 chicken croquettes, spinach croissant, 2 cheese pastries, dulce de leche napoleon, strawberry shortcake, Italian cheesecake, and last but not least a fruit tart. Oh my... I had no idea what I did until I got back to my friend's house with the box of goodies. Between the two of us, we stared at each other thinking.. how are we going to finish everything between the two of us?! At first I didn't think too much of it as I was FINALLY excited to try Porto's for the first time. I started digging into the potato balls and then the chicken croquettes. Both were very good but I prefer the flavor of the chicken croquettes over the meaty filling of the potato balls. Try it with their chipotle dipping sauce, it's a good pair. Next item to try was the guava & cheese pastries. I had two of them and was ready to move onto desserts. We split the desserts into halves for the two of us to enjoy. I was in pleasure with the flavors of each dessert. Again, it wasn't overly sweet and I loved that about it. But my pleasure became painful quickly as I realized I kept eating while already full.. The pain was worth it. I'm already craving the guava & cheese pastries again, not to mention I want some more of the chicken croquettes again too.

It also came with lettuce and tomato on wheat. What made this sandwich so amazing was that the oils and seasonings from the roasted veggies blended into the hummus spread which made for a savory drippy dressing. A simple nix of the havarti cheese, a side of plantain chips which caught the legit flavors of the savory drippy dressing, and I was happy :)If you're thinking \"Who orders a friggin' veggie sandwich from Porto's?
