[{"content": "Always a place we stop by before heading back to the Bay Area. I love their baked goods. I always get their cheese rolls and potato balls for home. This time my husband ordered the pastrami sandwich and I got their white chocolate mocha coffee. Both were very good. As always the place was soo busy, but they have a system down that you get helped quickly so it's not that bad. 4 stars because when we picked up my coffee and the sandwich, the system of figuring out your things were ready are kind of unknown.

Remember it's a Cuban restaurant so don't expect vegan food. They also go through and show you your order before you pay....so pay attention.
