The one bakery item that i did really love was the cheese bun -- I took it as a recommendation from the woman who was helping me. It was like a savory sweet danish/croissant. I would come back and eat in their restaurant -- it's really a beautiful building! If I ever needed fancy desserts I would also get them from here. They're beautiful as well!

Well, all the rumors are true! Portos is to the baked goods connoisseur what a Michelin 3-Star restaurant is to a gourmet diner. Their fruit-tarts are as colorful as their story and the variety of their menu. Whether you are lucky enough to live within reach of their Glendale, their Burbank or their Downey stores or you're from out of town and your friends \"drag\" you through the door; once you enter their store you will find fellow Portos' lovers indulge in decadent Cheese Rolls, Guava-Refugiados, Cheese strudels, and of course their infamous Potato Balls. I have not had a single piece of the many different items I have tried over the years that wasn't creative, decadent and most importantly delicious. My friends know that my favorite cake is Portos' White Chocolate and Raspberry creation, which has become a guest favorite at my birthday parties. One word of caution, though... uncontrolled indulgence and the hard-to-control desire for more Portos once you got \"hooked\" may be hazardous to your weight. :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Ben N.", "time": "1/1/2016"}, {"content": "I can not get enough of this place.Great food and patties & friendly staff.I loveeee the butter croissant.

Shorter lines, much easier parking, all with the same great pastries and food! Though lines may look long, they move really fast. The line wrapped twice when I got there, but I got my pastries and was out of there within 15 minutes! The employees are really nice and helpful, always doing everything with a smile. They don't rush you, and if you aren't sure what to get, they'll even offer you a sample. They do things quickly to ensure lines move fast. My favorite here is still the freshly baked cheese roll. I can never get enough! The tamale is actually pretty good too if you want more than dessert. It's filled with some corn and meat and not very salted, the way I like it. The meat pie has a sugary flaky crust with a little bit of meat inside. It's a nice little snack that is great on the go. I love me some Portos and I will surely be back!

The flavours in the sandwiches are amazing - they go together really well, the meat is good and the bread is fresh.Cheese rolls - incredibly more-ish...eat 1 and you'll want 4 more.

So that still makes the one in Glendale my favorite.I've found that the food is consistently good at both locations. The prices don't vary, either. Here are my stand-bys that never steer me wrong:- Mashed Potato Balls: I absolutely crave these -- they're stuffed with ground meat and spices, and is oh-so-comforting. Eat them while they're hot and fresh, though, since they don't really reheat well and they're just meh at room temp.- Cheese Rolls: My family loves these. Flaky, pastry with creamy, sweet, slightly tangy cheese? Yum. These are like cheese danish on steroids. My favorite parts are the slightly browned bits of cheese that harden up a bit and get crispy. - Spinach Feta Croissant: If you love spinach dip, you'll love it packaged in a buttery, flakey croissant!- Horchata Shake: Cold, icy, milky, sweet with a hint of cinnamon. Delish!- Pan con Lechon: Delicious pork, great bread. Plantain chips on the side. Yummy, but can be a bit on the dry side -- it's varied for me in the past.Things that I thought were good but not great: meat pies, guava strudel, creme brulee.

Good thing I only decided on trying the warm pastries because that was plenty to fill my greed. I got a box of the Yelp Highlights - cheese roll, potato ball, meat pie and guava & cheese roll.
