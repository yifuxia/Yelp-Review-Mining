[{"content": "Omg. Yums. So we were grabbing lunch in between our showing at Conan O'Brien and decided to stop by here. There was two long lines on both opposite sides. One was cafe and was bakery. We decided to go for the cafe since we were HUNGRY. We ordered:Potato Balls ($0.90 each)Torta Steak ($6.70)Southern Salad with Chicken ($6.95)Flan Caramel ($1.95)Milk and Berry Tart ($3.50)Out of all of those, the potato balls were my fave! Everything else was okay. It was good, but that amazing. The potato balls were AMAZING. On the outside it's crispy and flakey, on the inside the potatoes is soft like mash potatoes with beef filling. Orgasm in mouth! AHHH. ;) We enjoyed our lunch. It was good, fresh, light and a great deal. I split it with the boyfriend, so our lunch date that made us feel pretty full comes out to be about $20. Not bad! I will come back, and order more potato balls... and will like to try other things since it's worth trying!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Liz P.", "time": "5/14/2013"}, {"content": "What can I say about Porto's that hasn't already been said? Their pastries are good, their sandwiches are good, their drinks are good. EVERYTHING IS GOOD, DANG IT. Potato balls are my weakness. That is until I tried the chicken croquettes. Salty, savory, seasoned chicken croquettes are my weakness now. The ham croquettes are also very good. Okay maybe I'm downplaying the whole croquette family. That stuff is insanely addictive. Anything from the hot case is sure to be a crowd pleaser, to be honest. I recently had a ham and cheese croissant (which sells out so fast!) and I feel like the buttery, fluffy, cheese, ham-y goodness was the best croissant I've had in a long time. It has a slightly sweet, slightly salty, but very savory flavor that made me question my life choices. As in \"why aren't I eating this for breakfast every single day of my life?\" Mango smoothies taste fresh and the white chocolate latte really hits the spot for me. Cheese rolls are in a league of their own. I am contemplating giving out cheese rolls for Christmas. That's hot freaking good they are.Long lines. Long long long lines. All the time. It gets crazy hectic in there. But they're efficient most of the time and the lines go fast! Everybody has to try Porto's once in their lives.

It's the go-to dessert spot for Burbank residents and LA foodies alike, and I should know, since, being the Burbankian in my circle of friends, I'm often given requests to bring cheese rolls, meat balls, and cake to events. The aforementioned are always a hit, especially to bring to parties or as a gift for multiple people. Whenever there's a theme for a holiday, Porto's is always sure to have cakes decorated accordingly, but we usually just stick to fruit tart, tres leches, red velvet, or milk and berries and simply add the little chocolate decoration that says \"happy birthday!\" Or whatever else you want it to say. Sometimes these chocolates are my favorite part on the cake.But the good doesn't stop at dessert - I've enjoyed a Cuba sandwich or two in my time, and Porto's doesn't disappoint. Their croissant sandwiches, the ones at breakfast, can get really heavy, but I can't complain much since it is a croissant sandwich I'm ordering. Though I can't help a glowing review, I have to admit they are busy, extremely so. Most times I can go in and out within 20 minutes (I even did so this past Easter and Thanksgiving), but there are certain random hours/days and holidays (Christmas) that I've been at Porto's for upwards of 2 hrs. You just have to plan in advance.However, rain or shine, none of that would stop me from going!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Pauline N.", "time": "4/12/2015"}, {"content": "Everything previously said is on point. This place is an excellent overall deal for some authentic central american baked goods (wife said it reminded her of her childhood meals). We had a variety of pastries + sandwiches to taste them all and everything was excellent. Tops for me was the \"midnight\" cubano, which is excellent pork/ham/pickles combination on sweeter and oiled bread (versus the traditional cubano which was a bit drier). The guava pastries are excellent, as well as the meat pies and the potato balls w/meat (and they keep well for a long car drive back up north and snacking). Also, get the quesadilla (which is not a cheese grilled tortilla, but rather more of a sponge cake type bread that is excellent). We did see, and participate in a long line, but we had our order in about 15 mins tops. Everything is excellent and amazingly priced (about 10 pastries/fried goods + 2 sandwiches + 2 drinks for under $30).

So they have a robust coffee menu, but also smoothies and shakes. They also have virgin mojitos, which is minty soda water of various types including passion fruit and strawberry. There are the usual sandwiches, salads, and soups. But I say go for the pastries. I've had the potato balls, meat pie, pineapple empanada, guava strudel, guava roll, spinach feta pastry, cheese roll, and Parisian cake. My favorite of all the pastries I've tried are the potato balls and meat pie. I just love the savoriness. The potato balls are crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside without being gummy, and the meat filling is at a good proportion. The plaintain chips are pretty good here too. Service is fast and efficient. It's bustling, but don't worry about finding a seat. Porto's also reminds me of a Cuban version of a Paris Baguette.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Jennifer W.", "time": "2/22/2014"}, {"content": "Coming from Norcal and 2 days before going home my dad decided to come here and get some potato balls for my cousin. She raves about these. What we didn't know was that there was going to be a long line. My dad decided to leave my brother and I in the car while he waited. We should have looked on yelp for reviews about lines before deciding to coming during lunch. My dad got a box of potato balls for my cousin and one for us to share back at our rental condo. Needless to say we were pleased and since my dad dislikes waiting on a long line, he had said it was worth it. Next time I visit Socal I'll definitely come back.
