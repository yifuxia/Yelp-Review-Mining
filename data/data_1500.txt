My fianc\u00e9 was very skeptical because I had said so many times how good it was but once he came here and tried it, he was hooked. We ate our dinner and a couple of pastries and he decided that we needed more to take home so we promptly got back in line while still holding our first box of goodies.

True, the wifey had hyped this place like mad, 2/3 of their reviews are 5-stars(!), and the jam-packed ordering area and the line around the building on Christmas Eve (yelp.com/biz_photos/port\u2026) only heightened the anticipation all the more. But it wasn't just about the hype. That day for me, Porto's didn't bring its A-game.Items are individually priced. Here's what we had:POTATO BALLS ($0.90): The only thing I loved. Deep fried flavor bombs of ground beef, tomato and mashed potato. The meat could've been seasoned better, though.MEAT PIES ($0.78): Ground beef in a flaky pastry. The layer of meat was very thin, and I felt like I was eating mostly pastry and air. (yelp.com/biz_photos/port\u2026)CHICKEN EMPANADAS ($0.99): Chicken and veggies in a pastry. Way more dough than filling.OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES ($0.45): Wasn't fresh out of the oven. Tasted like something I'd get from a package.Prices aren't cheap per se, but I wouldn't have minded if the quality had been better.Maybe this review isn't fair because Porto's was crazy swamped that day, which caused their food quality to suffer. But life isn't fair. You only get one chance to make a first impression. If I'm having a terrible day and go into an interview and bomb it, does it matter if I'm *normally* on top of my A-game? Should I be given a second chance? Maybe. But I wouldn't count on it.So should I give Porto's a second chance? Maybe. A 66% 5-star rating does speak for itself. But in the meantime, I believe my review is fair.

Well my husband and I were walking about in downtown burbank and just happen to stumble apon it! Initially we were intimidated by the long lines out the front door , but surprisingly they move pretty fast and there are multiple lines depending on what you want. We were just there to get a little pre dinner treat, but what amazes me were all the people who were walking out with multiple bags filled with treats. Needless to say, our desserts were amazing!

Maybe it's because someone brought it for me before I got to witness the amazing place myself.I HAVE HENCE BEEN OBSESSED WITH PORTO'S. circa 5 months ago when I was in Burbank & decided to drop by. 5 months later, I'm quite obsessed. Particularly, once I tried their MEAT PIES I was a gonner. And chicken empanada. I've always enjoyed their cheese rolls, but it was never enough to drive 40 miles to get porto's. Now, I'll make it a point to get myself there!Their pumpkin pie during the holidays are solid. Conclusion: I'm not a believer of hypes, but I do understand why Porto's is famous. It is very good, solid food (savory and sweet) and it's really quite cheap.

Let's see.... The ONLY way to not have to wait in line? Get there when they first open up! I had to drop someone off at the Burbank airport really early one Sunday morning and even though I didn't really feel like having pastries I knew this would be the one chance I would have to step into Porto's and walk right up to the counter and not have to deal with the crowd so I jumped at the opportunity. It was kind of a weird feeling with so few people around, however, I could feel a swell of people starting to build the longer I pondered my selection. \u00a099% of what they offer is awesome especially for the price. My personal favorite is the cheese roll. There have been a few times where I've exceeded my recommended daily caloric, cholesterol, sodium intake in one sitting because someone would bring a couple dozen of these to a potluck party and I would eat about 6 or 7 of these. The ONLY item I'm NOT a fan of are the cupcakes. In my opinion, they're very un Porto's and it's kind of an embarrassment when I think about it because almost everything else is great. Since this is all subjective, I'm not sure how to convey disappointment over them because I feel like I'm a weirdo or something. Kind of almost like if I thought rainbows, puppies and kittens were repulsive. Who would think something crazy like that?Anyway, I had their red velvet cupcake and it totally missed the mark. The same can be said of the vanilla cake / vanilla frosting and chocolate cake / chocolate frosting cupcakes. Maybe because the frosting was more like a mousse and wasn't sweet enough or dense enough for my tastes and the cake tasted like standard fare? I'm not sure. All I know is I just took one bite of each one and the rest went into the garbage can.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Rich O.", "time": "2/14/2014"}, {"content": "I had their Strawberry Shortcake, Chocolate raspberry, Tiramisu and they were all delicious!
