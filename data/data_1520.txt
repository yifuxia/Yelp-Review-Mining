Customer service is fantastic, their prices are great, especially for what you get. Their sandwiches are to die for (the Cuban, the Italian, omg they're sooo good, loaded with meat, huge, and like $5-$6!!!) their soups are so delicious, I could go on & on. Porto's saved me last minute when my son's cake order from a different bakery didn't go thru... And then for my son's birthday, they made the most gorgeous, delicious, custom-made cake and really went the extra mile--I had taped a little tea light into the lighthouse on his cake, and when I picked up the cake, the tea light had been kindly glued into place by Porto's, and was switched on (which was difficult to do). Just little things like that really make ALL the difference. On top of their food being to DIE for.

Take some home for sure and stuff it down anyone near you. It is better fresh. So eat some while you are at the bakery. The only reason i give it a 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the long wait (still worth it) and the fact that you will end up spending A LOT OF MONEY THERE.

I have tried the Potato Ball and it's a meal in it's self. It's a soft mashed potato ball, filled with seasoned ground beef and is deep fried. You can't just eat one.

The other is the Meat Pie. It's a crusty puff pastry with seasoned ground beef. It's savory & fills you up. I've also had the Mango and Guava Smoothies. The smoothies are a bit to sweet for my taste buds but very refreshing and rich in flavor. The Chai Tea Latte with Soymilk is also good. Also too sweet for me but very flavorful.

So grab a number and get in 1 of 2 long lines. You can admire the pastry case as you wait! When its your turn they'll give you a pastry sample and take your order.I've loved everything I've tried at Porto's but definitely have my favorites when it comes to their sandwiches and pastries.Cubano Sandwich is a steal! \u00a0$4.85 for a flavorful sandwich on soft Cuban bread, slightly toasted so there's a bit of crunch. \u00a0The tasty vessel is stuffed with slices of ham, slow roasted pork, swiss cheese, mustard, mayonnaise, garlic and pickles- which give the sandwich a nice kick! When you dine in at Portos, sandwiches come with long and thinly cut mariquitas (plantain chips), garlic dipping sauce to go with. If you buy your sandwich to-go they don't come with mariquitas but they may just throw it in if you ask. Mariquitas are light, simple, yet tas-ty, and a nice change from the usual side of chips or fries, which most places serve sandwiches with.My mom loves the margaritas so much so that she has me buy a box, or 2; you have to remind them to give you garlic sauce on the side or you'll miss out.Guava cheese & cheese rolls are my go to pastries.Both rolls are fresh flaky puffs, guava is filled with the right amount of fruit/sweetness and cream cheese and the cheese rolls are filled with cream cheese and topped with sugar. I order these rolls in huge quantities when I go to parties, my friends and family love it!If you haven't tried Porto's, what are you waiting for?

Parking: A convenient back lot with plenty of parking available. (Glendale has parking garages that are a day's walk away, plus you can't always find your car where you swore you parked it) 2. Wait time: I got there 30 minutes to closing on a Friday night, and I literally didn't have to wait. I went right up and ordered. (Glendale, 30 minutes to closing on a Saturday, 10 minute wait in line)3. Selection: They had fruit tarts (and everything else) in stock! (Glendale had run out of fruit tarts)Here is what to get:Cheese roll ($0.70): only get the guava and cheese pastry ($0.75) if the cheese roll isn't sweet enough for you. They're the same thing basically but I like the cheese roll better. Mango mousse ($2.95) Fruit tart ($2.95): Delicious! It was literally perfect. Potato ball ($0.90): If you're not going to eat them right away get them at room temperature. It cheaper that way, they won't get soggy, and it still tastes the same. Chicken empanada ($0.99)Raspberry gold rush ($3.50): I think I just really like pudding, chocolate pudding. The only thing I can't recommend getting is the meat pie ($0.78) that Michael S is such a fan of, or maybe I got one that just didn't taste as wonderful as the one he had.

Bought a mango mousse for a birthday celebration and everyone loved it! The texture of the mousse just melts in your mouth, and it is lightly sweetened so the sugary taste is not overwhelming. The fruit tart, though, is sweeter than the mango mousse, but has more variety of sugar glazed fruits, which is a treat for the eyes.It is very reasonably priced as well, I believe the fruit tart was around 20 and the mango mousse is just a couple of bucks more.The service is impeccable. Very friendly, efficient, and overall A+! Love the fact that they will add custom lettering if it's for a birthday or anything without extra charge. Also love the fact that everything is so fresh!
