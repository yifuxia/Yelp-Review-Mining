Line was at the door around 2pm but moved quickly. Ordered 12 dozens of pastry and it was ready in less than 10 minutes which is reasonable. Also gave us an extra pastry probably bc we placed such a huge order.The dulce de leche latte was good, similar to a caramel macchiato but more caramel.Prices are fair for the quality of food in return.

Where else you still get great sandwich for less than $5, or a meat pie or a potato/cheese/chicken ball for ...$1 (yep - one dollar)! Very tasty food, everything is fresh, served very quickly. Outstanding selection of sandwiches, pies, and I'm not even talking about the bakery which is to die for.Can't recommend this place high enough if you are looking for the tasty meal at a great price (I personally want to thank Garrett, our guide at Warner Brothers studios for his recommendation).", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Anatoli L.", "time": "2/21/2014"}, {"content": "Best bakery EVER.

I frequent both the Burbank and Downey locations and love them both equally. We came in after 6:00pm on a monday, and it wasn't too busy. We got through the line in like 10 minutes (this is really fast for Porto's). \u00a0Here is what I ordered on my most recent visit to the Burbank location with my wife and son.The Potato Ball: This appetizer consists of a soft mashed potato ball filled/action packed with seasoned ground beef, and fried till golden brown. These are the bee's knee's man, and are like $0.90 for each one. I usually get a bare minimum of 4 per visit. \u00a0The Dinner Plate: This meal consists of white rice, black beans, ripened and golden fried plantain slices (maduros), grilled onions, and the option of chicken, steak, shredded beef (ropa vieja), or shredded pork (lechon). My wife chose the steak option with her dinner plate. This particular meal is served daily only after 2pm. The Dinner Plate was $7.65 and what a deal at that!The Caprese Sandwich: This sandwich consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh basil, capers, butter, and Italian dressing all on a rustic baguette. \u00a1Muy delicioso! I went out on a limb ordering this sandwich as it had more of an Italian feel to it, and I had never had it before. This particular sandwich was $6.50 and was well worth every penny! I was very pleased with my decision to order this sandwich. :)The Cheese Roll: This awesomeness consists of a sweet, flaky pastry dough thats filled with a cream cheese filling. These are sooooo addicting! For $0.70 per roll, a dozen is never an uncommon thing in my order. I love almost everything from this place, and will continue to give them my business for many years to come. The crowds of people will give you a hint that this place is the REAL deal!!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Marc L.", "time": "2/3/2014"}, {"content": "PARKING SUCKS and there is always a huge line so you need to be very patient.
