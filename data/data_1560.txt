Every portion size and taste palette will be fulfilled. I'm a bit claustrophobic, so the simultaneous lines and constant crowds would normally deter me. But...the food. Delicious potato balls of perfection. Delicate guava-cheese pastries. A smorgasbord of desserts in cups, tarts and napkins. Even their smoothies and coffees are good. Not to mention the awesome banana chips...and now my mouth is watering.If you're not meat-friendly, and not in the mood for something appetizer-sized, there are some good items and ways to tweak the sandwiches. (The potato balls are filled with delicious meat, if you're a diet-restricted first timer.)Parking is ok at best, and it's not a stop and go shop. But bring Porto's to a party, a lunch or just reunite with an old friend there, and you'd be hard-pressed to find something that beats the spot.PS - It's in the Top 10 restaurants on yelp for a reason!!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Micki B.", "time": "3/3/2014"}, {"content": "They're number 1 and famous not only for their food but for their service.It's a high stress environment but everyone is so happy to serve you.They ran out of potato balls and I had to wait half a hour for them. \u00a0The server remembered me and got me my order right away when they came out without having me wait in line all over again. \u00a0Super cool!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "David W.", "time": "1/9/2014"}, {"content": "Love their White Cupcakes! \u00a0I don't think I've had any better cupcakes than here. \u00a0Their buttercream frosting is bomb. \u00a0I normally don't like buttercream frosting but theirs is truly impressive.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "M F.", "time": "11/18/2015"}, {"content": "Hate that I love this place so much.

To bad they are only in the LA area. \u00a0My husband and I had the Cubano sandwich, potato leek soup and potato balls. Everything, even the bread is homemade.
