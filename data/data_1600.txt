[{"content": "I feel like I'm yelping the obvious here, but this place is consistently amazing. \u00a0It's a Cuban based menu with baked good that seem to go on for miles. Only problem is, everyone seems to know about it so it's DMV crazy, but less depressing. Sometimes the line goes around the block. That's why one less star, you wait for the Cubano sandwiches (less than five bucks) or the potato balls (about a buck each) for 45 minutes and may not have a place to sit and enjoy.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Meg G.", "time": "4/27/2014"}, {"content": "On the drive back up to the bay, we were requested to stop by to pick up some items from here. There's a small lot and some street parking, but it's always constantly busy that it's difficult to find a spot. Inside, there are two long lines but they go fairly fast. There are lots of tables but with the constant flow of people, they get taken very quickly. Customers here are pushy as well. I don't prefer to fight people to place an order. :/Items we ordered:Dulce de Leche Kisses: ($0.50) Light and crispy butter tart dough, filled with dulce de leche, topped with powder sugarFlorentine Cookie: ($0.55) A thin crunchy cookie made with almonds and sugar then dipped in chocolateAlmond Danish: ($1.15) Sweet laminated dough filled with almond pastePotato ball TM- Stuffed Potato: ($0.90) soft mashed potato ball filled with seasoned ground beef, fried to golden brownRefugiado TM- Guava & Cheese Pastry: ($0.75) Flaky puff pastry filled with guava and cream cheeseThe last time I tried all these items, someone else had brought them to try. I thought the pastries were only ok. But then, I had one straight from the source. It's massively different when you get them fresh. So de-lish! Everything full of flavor and enough savory/sweet depending on the item.

The pulled pork sandwich (pan con lechon) is just okay but their steak sandwich (pan con bistec) is delicious!! The chicken empanadas and cheese rolls are also good.

We were a little in a rush so I didn't want to stop but thank goodness he made me go anyway. From the street you smell the awesomeness that is whofting out of this pace. They have every single type of pastry/bakery item you could ever think of! Everything looks so fresh and homemade that it is impossible to get just one item. We got the Cubano sandwich and I have to say it has to be one of the best ones I have ever had. There was a little bit of a wait for it cause the place has lines for days, but I will wait for a good Cubano any day! They have these amazing fried plantain chips that you dip in a pesto type sauce...and I do not know how I am going to live without these weekly!! SAD FACEThe pastries were delicious also.

The workers are very efficient, and if you're busy looking at the menu and pastries in the glass, you find yourself being called up sooner than you think. I recommend writing your list down to read off to them, because they are experienced enough to memorize everything and grab it for you as you wait to pay at the register. There's two lines - to the right is if you want pastries, cakes, sandwiches, all of the above. The left side line is more if you want to just grab food and drink items, and it usually moves a bit faster too. For those who ONLY want drinks, you can actually walk straight up to the middle register. But don't try and order anything else, it's only going to make things complicated and people irritated. The atmosphere is pretty nice as well. I always get a fancy yet family-oriented vibe when I come in here. It's kept really clean, and there's plenty of tables, though you still have to be on the lookout for open spots. It's hard to find anything negative about the place when the food and service is up to par. My only complaint is the parking - it's pretty cramped, and you'll have to pay attention to the one way directions. Beyond that, I'll agree with everyone - Porto's is definitely worth the wait.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Michael H.", "time": "1/2/2014"}, {"content": "At this moment, not satisfied with Porto's, food is amazing and I cannot complain BUT the customer service at this location blew my last visit off to where I do not wish to go back and I hope this is the only location that creates this type of incident. I went in to purchase a cake and pastries. Normally at other locations, when I purchase the cake they allow me to get pastries as well. In this location, I attempted to get pastries with the cake and the lady helping me out was so repugnant and said I cannot purchase pastries with my cake that I had to make line in the long line IF I wanted to purchase pastries and declined to assist me. This is the first time I have ever had an incident at ANY Porto's location. They refused to make the order bigger and get a bigger sale from me basically.
