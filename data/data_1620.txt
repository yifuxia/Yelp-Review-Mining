I have been coming here for over a year and there hasn't been a single time that the line hasn't been out the door. The good thing is, they ALWAYS have enough workers to keep the line moving quickly. Not only do they have every dessert pastry and cake that you could possibly imagine and for an EXTREMELY good price, they have yummy coffee as well as savory pastries such as meat pies and potato balls incase you have more of a salt tooth than sweet tooth. Most bakeries would charge around $4-5 for decorated pastries of this quality, but theirs are between $2-3. You can get a whole cake or just a slice and they also have deli-type sandwiches if you're stopping by for lunch. I love the crowd here as well.

It's solid, offering great food, pastries, and drinks at reasonable prices.I've visited Porto's many times and had the opportunity to try sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. I really enjoyed the tuna melt (all the times I ordered it except one where the cheese wasn't completely melted) and the Pan con Lechon (roasted pork) sandwich. The shredded pork is \u00a0tender and flavorful and the sandwich itself was under $6 and came with some of their delicious, lightly salted plaintain chips. Their coffee, both the regular and speciality drinks (if you are in a decadent mood go for a White Chocolate Mocha), is really good as well. And the pastries and snacks? Awesome. For selection I'd have to give them 5 stars--they have everything: cakes (plain, and fancy ones like opera cakes), cupcakes, sugar cookies, Danishes, empanadas, and the list goes on. I love the cheese Danish as well as their spinach cheese pastry (one of my favorites)--it's got a nice flaky crust with savory spinach and cheese (feta, I think) interior. The meat pies are full of flavor and the potato balls are really good too. The lines are typically long, which is annoying, but they tend to move quickly. One reviewer mentioned that the staff aren't friendly, but I've found them fairly helpful (when I had questions) and also when looking for table. They are very good about helping you find one. Overall, Porto's is one of my favorite LA area places and while I don't visit as often as I'd like, I do make it a point to return because it's quite delicious.
