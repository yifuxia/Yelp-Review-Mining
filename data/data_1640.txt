[{"content": "Duh, everyone loves Porto's. I mostly go there for cakes. The tiramisu and fruit tart are elegant and delicious. The potato balls, chicken balls and meat pies are great to bring to a party or bbq. Only downside is the parking situation, they have a lot in back but it is always full, probably easier to find street parking and walk it.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Kari K.", "time": "11/22/2015"}, {"content": "What? No review? That's weird. Now I have to do the whole shebang, instead of just an update...* Free parking at the private lot but it's never enough. I don't think I've ever found a spot here ever. I always had to use street parking.* As with the Glendale store, there is a separate line for whole cakes only... and it goes a LOT faster.* The line area for pastries is more spacious.* The layout is more organized. That's probably because they were able to design this from the ground up, unlike the Glendale one which was an expansion.* The people here are less patient. On three separate occasions, some people were RUDE and SHAMELESS enough to cut in front of us in the line. Tacky!They just came out with the dulce de leche kisses and were giving them out for free.

They are a well oiled machine. \u00a0The only complaint I have is the parking. The parking sucks, but there is nothing that they could do about it because of the location. Even though the parking discourages me from visiting during busy moments, I'm still giving them 5 stars because they have made efforts to purchase and or rent nearby lots. Also, they have provided Valet Parking. \u00a0Also, they can be really busy during rush hours; Lunch, Dinner, etc., but this is because they are that damn good.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Prince N.", "time": "12/24/2014"}, {"content": "Awesomeness!!!

The pictures speak for themselves. The name was suppose to be BIJAN. You would think for such an upscale bakery they would double check the spelling, but no. Then to make matters worse the piece of white chocolate they used to write \"happy birthday bjan\" on had writing on both sides where one was a mess up and the other was a poor job of happy birthday and even had the wrong name on the sign. If I was the one to pick it up I would have checked it but I had someone else pick it up and they did not check. annoyed.Sloppy job.
