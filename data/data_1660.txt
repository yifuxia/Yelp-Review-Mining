[{"content": "Finally, I can say that I have experienced Porto's! Porto's is everything that everyone said it was, and more! My sister and I headed here after watching a dress rehearsal at the Disney studios. Thankfully, we made it in the doors with about 15 minutes to spare. Even though Porto's was almost closed, there was a full line for the pastries and it seemed like they were still bringing out fresh batches of pastries. I was in awe of the selection AND how cheap everything was! Usually, bakeries charge a lot for each pastry, but not Porto's! There were pastries that were $.30! Since it was my first time, I asked the employee for suggestions and I ended up getting everything that he recommended. He even gave us each a free dulce de leche kiss, because I wasn't sure if I wanted it or not (I bought 4!). Not only are their pastries extremely inexpensive, their loaves of bread are cheaper and fresher than the ones that I find at Ralph's! Excellent service. Inexpensive, but SCRUMPTIOUS pastries. My favorites:Guava cheese rolls, potato balls, cheese rolls, Cuban bread (which they can slice for you!), dulce de leche kisses. The thing that put it over the top was the fact that Porto's prepares bags of pastries and breads for people who don't make in time. These are grab bags of different goods! Porto's doesn't have to give anything to those who don't make it in time, but they do! Will definitely drive to Burbank, JUST to come to Porto's! I have to try everything on their menus!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jasmine Y.", "time": "2/19/2014"}, {"content": "The desserts are delicious!!! Definitely try the cheese rolls and the elephant ears. The ladies at the counter are super fast. Maybe too fast... They charged me for three sandwiches instead of two... And then when I got home- I had received the wrong sandwich. And the \"cherry\" on top- it also contained someone's long brown hair. My Aunt who took me there after bragging about their service was really embarrassed.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Reese D.", "time": "6/14/2015"}, {"content": "Sometimes parking is a drag, but I try not to let it deter me. The lines usually go quickly. Sometimes the cakes seem sort of pricey, but then I think of what cakes cost at Von's or Ralph's and the extra cost of a Porto's cake seems worth it.

I didn't understand the hype before but after my last two encounters, I am a HUGE fan. Since I was visiting a friend for the Labor Day weekend, I roped her into driving me to the Burbank location. When we pulled up, the line was out the door but the staff was very nice and accommodating. Ended up ordering a dozen cheese rolls (YUM) and their dulce de leche kisses as well as their raspberry kisses. Total ended up being around $13, which is super cheap! My friend ended up buying a meat pie, an eclair, a loaf of sourdough, and some cheese rolls. If it wasn't so busy, I would have opted to checking out some new desserts but I'm very content with my purchase.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Lexie P.", "time": "9/7/2015"}, {"content": "I don't even live here, but every time I visit LA, I always drive out to Porto's in Burbank for lunch. \u00a0The midnight cuban has my name on it. \u00a0This is not the place for timid people. \u00a0Don't get in line until you know what you plan to order. \u00a0If it's your first time, try to stand near the cashier and observe how to order before getting in line. \u00a0No matter what you decide to order, you will love the freshly baked bread that it's served on or the outstanding pastries teasing you from behind the glass counters. \u00a0Very filling and reasonably priced. \u00a0Gracias Porto. \u00a0Muy bien.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "M W.", "time": "5/7/2016"}, {"content": "One of the best bakery in LA!

Their pastry section here is huge!!! My review is going to be based more on the \"food-food\" then the bakery-deserts.Order up at the left counter & find a seat quick. You are handed a number when dining in, so just sit back & wait for your heavenly meal :).Suggestions:***Obviously their meat stuff potato balls are the best, please give them a try you won't be disappointed. *their Cuban sandwiches here are great, very filling- I'm not a huge fan of the fried plantain chips that come on the side but no biggie.*guava everything is a must!!! I'd highly recommend their guava smoothie & guava-cheese pastry.

Very unique. I love the rellenitos! Rolled in sugar very delish Cuban style put into a bite sized portable portion. I noticed the ones from Glendale aren't rolled in sugar also ordered the spinach feta pie triangle pastries from Glendale and here I think they only have the spinach feta croissants which I was given and didn't know I don't like them they're like soggy and wet nothing like the triangles from Glendale idk why they have different stuff. This place is overly annoyingly crowded but the lines move faster that it looks.. They should have separate for take out and dine in for sure!!! No parking around here either. I always get take out and they always seem to leave things out of my order that I ask for they never write down what u want they just listen and then go get everything I always order a lot. I still have so much to try but I like the coconut streusel pastries and cheese rolls, the seafood potato balls are alright but need less potato. Most of the things from here like non sweet pastries lack a little flavor and need some sauce for sure like the meat pies or potato balls more seasoning or sauce! I ask for the chimchurri but usually it's forgotten in my order or they give me the wrong items cause some of them look the same like one Time I ordered 20 cookies 10 dulce and 5 rasberry and they gave me ALL RASBERRY I was mad because I really wanted to try the dulce ones and only threw in rasberry because.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Tyler M.", "time": "3/6/2016"}, {"content": "Porto's is always on my list of places to eat at when I am in LA. I sometimes want to go crazy and order one of everything in the pastry case, but that would be silly so I just stick to my usual of guava cheese strudels and guava rolls, potato balls, and chicken empanadas. My favorite breakfast sandwich is the ham and cheese. The long lines are deceiving, dont be afraid or think it will take forever to get through, because it wont.

Mention the name Porto's to anyone in southern California and you'll get a response of \"ooooooh I love that place\" or your coworkers telling you they've jealous and begging you to take them with them to Porto's next time. I used to live around the block from here and would frequently stop in a couple times a week. What's good here? Everything. \u00a0Will there be a line? Yes, but don't fret, they are very speedy and the line moves really fast. My favorite go to's: turkey croissant. Fresh oj made on the spot. Cafe mocha. Cheese balls. Triple mousse dessert. And lastly, the cakes are AMAZING! The special line just for cake only is out the door right before major holidays like thanksgiving. But it is sooooo worth it! My family out of state beg me to take them here whenever they come to visit. Also, i recently moved over 100 miles away to San Diego and in STILL running into people all the way down here who love Porto's. Whenever they're driving through the LA area they stop in.
