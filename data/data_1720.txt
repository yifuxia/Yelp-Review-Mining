[{"content": "Can I say party in my mouth??Porto's Bakery was probably the highlight of my weekend trip down in LA. Yes, it outdid the amazingly awesome Transformer's ride at Universal studios... and yes, it did, in fact, also outdo all the fun I had walking down Venice Beach, the walk of fame, and Beverly Hills... combined.I'm so happy we got a little lost looking for our hotel and I spotted this place! Woohoo! Okay, I digress.Porto's is definitely the place to try if you're in the area. Everything tasted AMAZING. Even the iced tea, heh.With that said, here are the things I got (and you should get, too!):- Cubano Sandwich: The bread was fluffy and wow, it had a nice balance. I usually don't like pickles, but the sandwich made it taste GOOD! It tasted bright and definitely delightful. If you want to eat as much variety as you can, I recommend just ordering a sandwich and splitting it with a friend. That only ends up about $2/person. Cheap, filling, and more important, delicious?! WIN. The sandwich also comes with plantain chips, so nomworthy. - Cheese roll: probably my favorite. I didn't really read the description, nor see it (the place was crowded and hectic), but it's actually a sweet bread with a sweet creamy filling... it's also sprinkled with some sugar. I ended up going in line again and buying another one... Please get this. AND it's only $0.80.- Mango Mousse: heaven on a plate. A must have dessert.... so fluffy... or, as Agnes from Despicable Me would say, \"IT'S SO FLUFFY!!\" It tasted perfect and I loooove mangoes. I wish I can eat one right now.- Tiramisu: Definitely on the richer side, but I loved the little crispy balls that add a nice texture. Yum.- iced tea: Okay, major kudos to Porto's for their iced tea. It wasn't too sweet, nor too bitter. Just perfect. And absolutely refreshing!! - Potato balls: Actually, this was a bit of a miss for me. It reminded me of the croquetas back when I studied about in Spain... but it just didn't taste as good. I'm probably being biased... I honestly don't know what the rage is all about. It may also be because it was fried and I'm not a fan of fried food. There's also a meaty filling inside, and I didn't really like that flavor.So, for the rest of the day, I ended up walking around feeling way too bloated but it was worth it. Despite being full after the sandwich, potato balls, and the cheese roll, I had to make round two and waited in line to buy the mango mousse and more cheese rolls. So. Worth. It.

We saw the line outside of Portos and were going to avoid that awfulness but when we smelled the goodness at the front door we had to stop. The line was long but moved quickly. The person taking our order was rude. He worked quickly bit it's important to not treat your customers like a burden. \u00a0It is loud in there and crowded so if you hate situations like that, I'd take the food to go or have a friend pick it up. Boy, am I glad we did stop though!!! The food was amazing!!We tried the: Potato Ball Sandwich, The Cubano, the Pan con Bistek, Plantain Chips, and Potato Balls.The Pan con Bistek was AMAZING!! Nice crunchy bread with flavorful beef and seasoning. My favorite by far!The Potato Ball Sandwich was so yummy also, but I would have been happy with just having a few potato balls on the side with my Pan con Bistek. The Cubano was yummy but was lacking something spicy. I would get it again and ask for pepperchinnis on it or something. The Plantain Chips threw me off because they were not sweet. But they were delicious!! They come free with your sandwich if you are eating in, but if you take it to go, you have to but them! But totally with it!Potato Balls are potato and batter mixed together to make a ball and they are stuffed with beef and spices. They are only 98cents each!! If you like to eat as much as I do, get a few on the side of your sandwich!!Last thing: there is a valet so I would recommend using it because parking is a nightmare and I mean like it could take 20 minutes to find parking and you may end up a mile away.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Faith W.", "time": "3/5/2015"}, {"content": "This is THE Caf\u00e9/Bakery.

It did not disappoint. Just about the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had -- and with plantain chips, yum!! And, the tasty dessert treat from the bakery case, an individual fruit tartlet was terrific.

Well now I know what to do for my third visit.The express line is to your left when you enter. The main line is to your right and the cake line is to your far right. So keep that in mind when you want the basic and most popular stuff, then go straight to the express line.But on this visit, I finally got to try the Cubano. It only took them a few minutes to make this sandwich and for just under 5 bucks, it was great, it's cheap and it's the perfect amount of meat and cheese in this sandwich.The guava and cheese pastry and the potato balls continue to give me those necessary carbs to make it throughout the day. And the chicken empanada is filling and is packed with the necessary proteins for those muscles.There's really no good time to come to Porto's since it is packed all the time and their parking lot is always full. I guess you can park across at the drugstore and maybe get your food and come back before you get ticketed or towed but you didn't hear that from me.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Mike C.", "time": "8/13/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "This place is amazing and unique!

BUT even when it was cold and almost a day old, it was still pretty darn good. I recently went to LA and on my way back home I had to buy some fresh and bring some back home. The potato ball was one hundred times better when they're fresh. I also got a few dozens of cheese rolls, VERY good. The pastry was light and little sweetness goes really well with the cheese filling. The lines were super long, I waited for almost half an hour, but it was worth ever minute.

Parking was...scary. However, the potato balls made it all worth it. The fruit tarts weren't too buttery nor too sweet. A big thing for me about fruit tarts: after one bite, will it crumble? Alas, THIS FRUIT TART FROM PORTO'S PASSED THE TEST!For everyone's first time here, I highly recommend to get 3 potato balls and 2 fruit tarts. Why?1 potato ball to try.Another to indulge in.And the last to share. Or..not. I'm not judging. Why 2 fruit tarts? Well...WHY NOT?!Cubano was pretty typical though. Not a very \"special sandwich\". It's good, but lacked a little somethin'. Gotta say though: it's pretty hard for some places to add the needed sparkle to their sandwiches.

My all time favorite is their dulce de leche kisses! Their chocolate croissants are a close second & like everyone else has said, the cheese rolls are delicious!This was my first visit to a Porto's location. My friend & I were in a car for a good 6 hours, so we were extremely excited to get to our lunch destination. Finding it was easy & we got there at a good time because the complimentary 1 hour parking was totally open. By the time we were leaving, people were waiting!When we walked inside, it was BUSY! If you go to the right, you can see their whole selection of baked goods & the left was more catered to the cafe portion of Porto's. The line went fairly fast - which was a bad thing.. I couldn't decide quickly enough! Too many good choices! My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach sometimes & this is one of those times. I ended up getting a turkey cheese croissant, a meat pie, a couple of potato balls, and a milk n berry for my dessert! The turkey cheese croissant was simple and bigger than I thought. My friend & I could've totally shared a sandwich and gotten more of the smaller items. It came with a side of banana chips - something different, but I liked them. The meat pie was alright - more pastry than meat. THE POTATO BALLS!! I noticed people getting BOXES of these.. it's THAT good! .. I should've followed their lead. Lastly, my dessert! The milk n berry was sponge cake layers soaked in tres leches with blueberries & strawberries: YUM.I am so glad I was able to finally check out Portos in person.
