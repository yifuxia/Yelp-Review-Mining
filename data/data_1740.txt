The cakes are super the potato balls are da bomb and the pastries super delicious. This Portos has a private parking and they also have a valet parking. The only negative thing i can say about the Portos is the long lines and the parking.

Potato balls), but the actual dining environment is a real sh$t show. It's cafeteria style and there's always a line, along with people milling around everywhere because there's no clear instructions on where to order and how and people's kids running every which way - usually right into you - so come during off-hours when it's a BIT less crowded and scope out menu ahead of time to make ordering easier.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Barbara L.", "time": "9/13/2015"}, {"content": "I'm not a huge fan of this place. \u00a0They're fine, but it's crowded and I don't think it's worth the wait.

Ive visited Portos many times and its Delicious! From their sandwiches , smoothies , patries , cakes , breads. Very tasty! Its busy so be prepared to wait. If youre looking for a great bakery , look no further. The staff is very friendly which is a plus! The parking lot is small but with a little patience you'll find a spot.

It's a detour off my dairy free, gluten-free diet (by choice) as fresh bread and well-crafted pastries are special treats! Isn't that half the journey of a vacation? Be forewarned though, that service is not PDQ, but so worth the wait! My brother introduced me to Porto's, one of his faves, before my active Yelp days. This location's bakery cases spreads out over a wider area than their Glendale site (which has a second floor above for ordering cakes there). The line for ordering just drinks is right next to the main cash registers, and the pastry line will take your food and drink orders. I usually have a Porto's Veggie sandwich on a croissant but the juices from the tomatoes and roasted eggplant makes it soggy. Next time I was there, my sister'in-law suggested trying it on a Cubano roll and it was wonderful, at $6.15 with no extra charge for bread substitution! My mother's ham sandwich was ordered on french bread. We assumed large \u00a0bread slices would be tender biting for her. It arrived on a french roll, nice and crusty, but not easy on her, so I asked the dining room supervisor if it could be redone, on a croissant. No problem. It came back more quickly than the original order and she loved the generous amount of tender ham in it! She gave away the crunchy fried plantain chips though, our gain! Their chocolate croissants have just an average amount of chocolate filling but the dough is light, flaky, and buttery! My mother loves the guava and figure-eight apple/cherry (?) danish. We always leave with a goody box for later snacking. They have some outdoor tables along Magnolia. We've found paid street parking along \u00a0Magnolia and a block east, with a right turn on Cordova Street, because their parking lot, behind the shop, off of Hollywood WAY, \u00a0is usually full. If you need to call the 9100# and receive a message that you can't be connected, keep trying, as it is a very popular place. Go before or after the lunch rush to best get a table to dine in at.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Shal W.", "time": "9/11/2014"}, {"content": "Just amazing. I always get brunch sweets from here when we have friends or family over for brunch. The almond croissants, cheese rolls, guava/cheese rolls are just delicious. I haven't had the savory items but I hear their sandwiches are even better, which is saying a lot! Birthday cakes ordered from here are always great looking and delicious. Prices are very reasonable and actually cheaper than 'high-end' pastry places, but portos quality is very high and consistently delicious.

This location in Burbank has parking in the back and it gets really busy in here. I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 for the wait time.They have very delicious pastries at Portos. You can go by the Slice or buy the whole cake. If your going by the slice there are so many selections you don't know which one to get. I suggest you start at one end so u can try different ones each time you come here. I love the cheese rolls here. They are always fresh and delicious. I also enjoy the strawberry cheese cake or the New York cheese cake. Very flavor full.When it comes to the cakes my favorite one is the Bavarian cream. It is very very flavorful. The cake line moves much quicker. \u00a0They also have great fruit tart cakes here.When it comes to there lunch menu everything is good. My favorite is the turkey melt. It comes with fried banana slices on the side. \u00a0I also love the potato balls. I recommend that to everyone. Overall Portos you guys rock.
