[{"content": "I go here too much. Yes, the potato balls and the cheese rolls are pretty bomb. \u00a0I've tried their Cubano and other sandwiches with the banana chips/dip. \u00a0Soo yummy. I like their smoothies a lot too! Love the horchata flavored one.Besides these usual favorites, anything with the croissant is also equally delicious. I like getting the spinach/cheese one. \u00a0And omg, the guava cheese rolls. MMMMM! The cakes are so perfect. \u00a0I highly recommend the tres leches, the apple custard tart, and any of their fruit tarts. \u00a0Their chocolate cakes are scrumptious! \u00a0The designs and presentations are very pretty!And I love how it's only a few minutes away from me!And yes, it does get crowded and busy. Parking is hard, but it's best to park across the street, or find street parking! Don't try to park inside their lot---it gets too crazy & your car can get scratched. But Porto's is pretty good at being efficient and you don't have to wait too long in line before you are served!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Kristine J.", "time": "9/3/2012"}, {"content": "its cheap and delicious!!but crowded and loud!!!long lines that takes forever.but the deal is so good it just might worth it.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Onion O.", "time": "8/24/2015"}, {"content": "This bakery was busy as usual.

The chicken has a wonderful chargrilled flavor and it's placed over romaine lettuce, black beans, avocado slices, tortilla strips, cheddar & jack shredded cheese, red bell pepper, tomatoes, and red onions, with house cilantro vinaigrette. So light and healthy, BEWARE... Their desserts are wonderful and many items to sample. \u00a0The owners are so gracios and kind and do many things in the commuity to give back. I think their employees are treated very well because I have never seen anyone give anything but kindess and respect to their customers. \u00a0 *They are very busy, but the line moves fast! I think because the quality of the food is so good and the pricing is so cheap for California! \u00a0They make awesome cakes for any occasion. My favorite is the Halloween cake from Porto's.

Porto's just on the way. Everyone is raving about its pastry and sandwich. After several tries, I think it's popularity are due to their friendly efficient services and reasonable price. There is \u00a0no doubt their pastry always fresh, that's why they taste great. After bring home and sit for half day, none of my family would eat them unless I rebake them. (same as many other famous bakery)We tried Cubano sandwich ($5.45)and Pan con bistec($6.98, beef sandwich), not impressed. Mango smoothie ($3.59 med. size) just like the one I made from frozen mango, nothing special. Since the price are reasonable, it's not a bad idea to go (If you can find a vacancy in their compact parking lot).If you like potato, then potato balls($0.98) are good. I like meat pie ($0.89, not much meat filling, that is why I like, just add flavor). I like cheese roll($0.75), or grava strudel ($0.78), guava cheese strudel ($0.8), mango turnover($1.35).Something special but I don't care much- coconut glaze($0.85), it's coconut flake ball covered w sugar glaze, the bright yellow color really attractive, but you have to love sweetened coconut to like it. Dulce de leche kiss($0.55) like short bread cookie w \"kiss\" shape. Its filling like brown sugar add some milk,not I expected. There is another kind of kiss w raspberry filling. I won't go all the way to Burbank just for bakery, but if I pass by that area, then I will get some pastry and eat on the way. The line always long, but it took about 30 min. to get out.

Give me one of everything please!They also have regular sized cakes on display but it's a first come first serve basis. If you wanted one guaranteed, you can always call and order in advance. As for the food, their cubano sandwich is well known. I'm not a fan of having so much meat in my sandwich but flavor wise, it was pretty good! I've tried their grilled chicken sandwich (mehh, nothing special), chicken fajita sandwich (pretty good) and their caprese sandwich (mehh). Their salads are decent sized but nothing too special about that either.
