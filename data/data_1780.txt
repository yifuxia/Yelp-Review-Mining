[{"content": "Porto's! Why haven't I found you sooner? It was my first time ever at Porto's Bakery. I have heard a lot about this place and have been wanting to try it. I came here on a Sunday and there were a lot of people inside the bakery, waiting in line to order. There were two sides where you can order pastries, sandwiches, and drinks. Both lines were as long as the ones you see at Disneyland! There is also a small parking lot, free for Porto's customers but finding a parking spot at Porto's involves circling around couple of times and stalking everyone that walks out of Porto's to their car. I waited in the long line for pastries. As each minute passed while I was in line, I kept wanting to order more and more pastries. So I ended up ordering the potato balls, cheese rolls, meat pie, banana nut muffin, and also creme brulee. I actually wanted to order more but I tried to hold myself back from doing so :P.But OMG the potato balls were the best out of all the things that I ordered. The beef inside the potato ball tastes like taco meat (in a good way). The potato wrapped around the meat was also really soft and fluffy and even though it was deep fried, it was not greasy at all. The creme brulee was also perfect! It was just the way I liked it. Even though everyone says the cheese rolls are a must get item from Porto's, I did not think it was super amazing. It was really good but I still think the potato ball is the best!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Idy T.", "time": "5/8/2012"}, {"content": "Long lines? Still worth it! I really like their bakery! I haven't gotten a chance to try their sandwiches and drinks yet but when I enter and wait in line for the bakery, it is as if I am in dessert heaven. I am already drooling when I stare at their display. The workers work pretty fast and they have a pretty good memory.I tried their cheese rolls, potato balls, creme brule, banana nut muffin, and meat pie. I thought the cheese roll was good but I thought it would have been bigger. The best was the potato balls. Oh my gahhhh.. I love how it's crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and also have another texture from the meat. Their creme brule is a must try if you like creme brule. I did not eat it right away but when I had it, the sugar layer was still crunchy and the cream is sweet, fluffy, and has a strong milky flavor.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Mary T.", "time": "5/18/2012"}, {"content": "The sandwiches where a tad overgreasy for my taste, not worth the wait", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Camilla M.", "time": "9/2/2015"}, {"content": "Sugar loaded!!! \u00a0Sugar, sugar, honey honey Portos knows how to sell it!!!! \u00a0Everything tastes sooo good thanks to the sugar load!!!

I tried the ham and cheese croissant which was just ok I liked the chips it came with which is just fried bananas I believe. It's pretty filling.

It is the best. My only problem is that there are WAY to many people here all the time. They need to manage all of the people.

Finally had a chance to do so. I went on a Sunday afternoon & it was packed! I only intended to get some pastries so I went on the bakery line. I believe they have a separate line for the cafe. They were having a deal on Cheese Rolls and Guava Cheese Strudels so I got 2 dozen of the rolls and 1 dozen of the strudels. Also got a dozen of Potato Balls. All were extremely delicious! Guava Cheese Strudels were sweet, good balance of guava jam and cheese. Potato Balls were such a surprise! Didn't expect to have some kind of meat thing in the center of the ball. It's great when it's warm.The Cheese Rolls were my absolute favorite though! Glazed with this buttery, sugary yummy thing and oh-so flaky dough. Cheese was sweet and salty inside. IT WAS HEAVEN.I've never had Cuban food or pastries, to say the least, so I can't compare to anything else. However, Porto's pastries are the best of its kind, I'm sure!Currently craving the Cheese Rolls as I type this!

Don't know what took me so long, but I'm glad I did. Potato balls had a crispy exterior despite being ready made and sitting under a heat lamp. The filling was delicious. It's actually a lot of food for about a dollar. Ordered the Cuban sandwich, because, well, this is a Cuban bakery. The thing is pretty huge for the size...and it's good! It's served with a side of crispy plantain chips. After seeing dedicated staff chucking oranges into a beastly sized orange juicer I knew I had to try something with orange. The orange blast smoothie was basically a natural version of orange bang. Amazing enough that I'll be back just for this. Also, they accidentally brought us an extra smoothie and ended up giving it to us anyway. Cool!This place is great for lunch. There is a bit of a wait, but it goes by quickly.

I think one month I actually visited this place over 5times. I really wished I had a closer one, but when the craving hits for Portos I make the drive. The potato balls and meat pies are always a hit when I buy them for a all get together or party.I enjoy their Cuban sandwich with either a mango smoothie or dulce de lech frapp which definitely fills me up. A great lunch! When it comes to deserts I am always satisfied with my choice. I try to choose a different desert to try. But so far abortive would be the cheese roll and tiramisu ;) I love their selection of cakes and at a really good price.

We were placed on standby for an hour, and in the end they told us we were no longer needed but they would still pay us for coming out (woohoo!). We decided to grab dinner at porto's before heading back to long beach. The things I picked up-Potato balls (but of course): there's something extremely addicting about fried balls of meat and potato. It's something so simple yet so enchanting. They're fun to eat and they're not greasy. My only problem I have with these cuban nuggets is the saltiness of the meat filling and how they're 400+ calories per ball. I can easily eat 4 of these, so that's 1600 calories. Oops. -Cheese rolls (obviously): SO FLAKY. SO CHEESY. and yet it's not overpoweringly sweet. Bravo! 80 cents each?! I'll take a box of 20....you know, for my family...- tortilla soup: this was the first tortilla soup I've ever had that was actually made with tortillas. It was very delicious on a stormy night like this. Two huge problems about this soup though: #1 it came out lukewarm #2 waaaaaaay too much cheddar cheese on top. I felt like I was eating cheese with tortilla soup. I'll skip the queso next time, Por favor. -NY Cheesecake: small dessert after dinner. Extremely creamy and smooth, very fresh but nothing too crazy here. Overall, it was a fun and lovely dinner. Everybody left happy and we had a great nice.
