[{"content": "LOVE this place for their baked goodies, sandwiches, drinks, and overall service.It's been a long overdue review but you must check this place out when your from out of town. \u00a0They have three locations so far in Burbank, Glendale, and Downey and are continuing to expand.I haven't tried everything yet but my go to favorites are:+ Guava cheese pastry+ Cheese roll+ Potato balls+ Chocolate chip cookies+ Dulce leche kisses+ Fruit tart (individual or full size cake)+ Triple chocolate mousse (individual or full size cake)+ Cubano sandwich+ Parisian chocolate cake+ Horchata smoothie+ Cheesecakes (mango, oreo, raspberry)Lines are always long any time of day but it moves fast. \u00a0The servers are always very helpful and accommodating. \u00a0There's a separate line if you are just ordering or picking up a cake. \u00a0You can use either lines to order items on their cafe menu.Stop reading and go check this cafe and bakery out. \u00a0Parking in their lot if you're lucky and street parking.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Dianna D.", "time": "10/4/2015"}, {"content": "4.5 stars. Finally made it to Porto's after all these years. I know if I tell people it was my first time there, everyone would be like, \"Whaaat?! Where have you been your entire life?!\" Lol~Anyways, tried couple things and decided my favorites were:1. Cheese roll $0.75/ea *Luv*2. Guava & Cheese Strudel $0.80/ea3. Potato ball $0.98/ea4. Dulce de Leche Kiss $0.55/ea & Reg Napoleon $3.15/sliceBoth the dulce de leche kiss & Napoleon were tasty, but too sweet for my liking. My co-workers' favorites were the cheese rolls & dulce de leche kisses.The hot Dulce de Leche Latte was pretty good as well, but my fav is still Cafecito Cubano con Leche from Tierra Mia.Porto's Iced Coffee only comes in large @ $1.99. Not bad for the price. Was told it's made with condensed milk. Taste fine/decent, but if I have to choose...would rather go for Vietnamese Iced Coffee over this (also made with condensed milk).", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Sasa F.", "time": "5/2/2016"}, {"content": "My favorite place on earth.

The potato balls are literally just fried balls of potatoes, but I can probably eat 15 of them in one sitting. I love the horchata latte and I haven't had a bad pastry. I've only tried the Cubano and the Medianoche, both of which are delicious. I love the bread and the amount of filling. They split the sandwiches in two which is great so you can eat half and leave the other half for later. Even with such big portions and such popularity, the prices are quite reasonable.

The employees that take your orders and grab your millions of boxes of cheese rolls and potato balls are AWESOME! They remember your massive list, go to the back and grab all the boxes, take your payment, and get you out of there pretty quickly.Yes, the line gets pretty long, but it actually goes by pretty quick.Quicker than ordering sandwiches for breakfast/lunch for dine-in... even take-out. We waited literally close to 25 minutes, only to find out our order had been ready and waiting at the counter. They hadn't called our number out. We were standing right by the pickup counter the whole time. BUT! I like Porto's too much to dock off any stars. The sandwiches are delicious. The pastries are a favorite with anyone and everyone you give them to. Their drinks are tasty.Usual orders:* Cheese rolls* Potato balls* Meat pies* Dulce de leche kisses (tends to get too sweet so don't eat too much in one sitting)* Dulce de leche latte* White mocha latte* Breakfast sandwiches--- any of the ones on a croissant* The cubano sandwich", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Steffi G.", "time": "4/5/2016"}, {"content": "Over 6000 reviews and the crowd at this place is unbelievable, like Disneyland.

The price is very cheap as well, it's insane! Porto is my weakness, How can you say no when all their stuff is so delicious without the heaps of fat and oil. Their baked potato balls with meat and meat pies are out of this world! I always have to have chocolate strawberries, napolean caramel cake and their coconut macarons : all are perfectly sweet without making you sickp.s for drinks try out their freshly squeezed orange juice or their delicious mango smoothieThis is a real bakery, with that homemade taste we all crave that reminds us of when grandma or mom would bakeThere are lines pretty much all day; but especially during lunch and dinner , the food is that good and how everything is ready made - just a quick warm up and then you can take it to go.

First of all, the bakery was established in 1960, and there is a reason why they are doing so well and are still around today. I was shocked to see the crowds as I entered through the main doors, that's a good sign. Bakeries have to be really exceptional to have that sort of following. The way they deal with such enormous popularity while not upsetting their customers with unnecessary wait times is through extreme efficiency. That doesn't mean that they skimp on customer service, I was delighted to be served by the most pleasant gentleman Chris ,see my photo. Chris made me feel like I was the only customer in the place. He made suggestions and gave me samples, business owners take note! Treat your customers as though they are special and give them great customer service and you have the recipe for successful business.Of course you can't give out free samples and expect people to purchase the product if the samples are not delicious. The prices are great and everything I tried was delicious. Perfect!Come to Portos, you will not be disappointed. Maybe you will be lucky enough to have the assistance \u00a0of Chris.

OMG - so YUMMY...BUT the MAIN reason is their Cubano sandwiches and their plantains - and you MUST ask for the dip for the plantains - it's a light green tangy salsa type dip. Their plantains are best fresh - super light and crunchy!! \u00a0Goes perfectly with their Cubano or by it self!! :)The Cubano is made with slices of slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, \u00a0with their perfectly balanced and seasoned cuban dressing on Cuban bread.
