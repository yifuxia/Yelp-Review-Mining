[{"content": "Today is my bosses birthday so I decided to go early in the morning to buy a cake for him and pick up some goodies for myself as well. There were literally 5 people in line and I was thrilled it was that short, because if you have been here you know that the lines are always ridiculous. I ordered a tres leches cake then I ordered 2 chicken croquettes 2 meat pies and 2 potato balls. When i got to my job in SANTA MONICA. I realized I didn't get the stuff i ordered and was overcharged. I don't understand how they screwed up when there was literally only 5 people in the line.

Well priced and does not disappoint. I have tried multiple things on the menu and have never eaten anything I've disliked. The other thing I love about Porto's is their customer service.

I highly recommend take-out on the bakery items, the line moves faster. \u00a0Parking is not really a problem, the lot attendants direct the cars to alternate lots. \u00a0Regarding the service, they need to process people quickly, so it feels a bit New Yorkish (rushed), so expect that. \u00a0I think it just adds to the ambiance.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Rita R.", "time": "3/24/2016"}, {"content": "This place is definitely a Glendale and valley favorite! I used to go to the original location in Glendale growing up and now I go to the Burbank location. None of the recipes have changed! Their pastries are always top quality and their CAKES!!! My birthday cake ALWAYS is a Porto's cake. My favorite pastry items from here are the potato balls, mango mousse, oreo cheesecake and the guava and cheese bread pastry. For food, I like the medianoche sandwich. For drinks, their FRESH orange juice doesn't disappoint; neither does their mochas and bottles malta's!

I'm not a fan of banana chips I don't believe something that already taste great need be ruined but to each their own having said that this specific item did not over all contribute to my review.

They all come with a mixture of soggy/normal/crispy plantain chips, and I'm honestly not sure if that is done on purpose to please everyone or just an accident.The pina colada smoothie was alright. One of my econ professors here at USC brought in cheese/guava cheese/coffee for the whole class from Porto's a few times because he's a nice guy and literally attendance would shoot up for the following few class sessions.I've also had the strawberry shortcake, tiramisu, mango mousse, millefeuille, milk n berry, fruit tart, opera, and tres leches. Out of all of those the milk n berry and tres leches are the two most memorable and the rest of them are just whatever. We ordered a 8\" milk n berry for my friend's birthday last year because he loves tres leches and it was a really easy process. The bigger size cake was just as good as the individual portions which is good.The only thing I don't like about Porto's is that it just seems so impersonal. It feels like it's just a large assembly line and they are semi-strict about seating.Tropicana is better, folks!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Dahlia S.", "time": "9/2/2012"}, {"content": "Porto's is like the Heaven of sugar and dessert if you like the genre.

The place looks neat, organized, and food is displayed nicely. I've eaten the Potato Balls, Guava and Guava/Cheese Strudel. All delicious. The price is reasonable too. The Strudel is $0.75 a piece. The lines can get long, but if you go before 4PM, it's not so bad. The employees move fast to keep the line moving. I appreciate the parking too. Despite only being a 1-hour parking lot, that's probably for the best... because if I hung out there to do work, I would end up eating 5 pastries in one visit.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Mike L.", "time": "2/7/2014"}]
