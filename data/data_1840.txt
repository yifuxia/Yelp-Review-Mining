Though, I do love them!This review is about an interesting incident I had today.I was at Portos with my husband enjoying lunch. We ordered a few of those aforementioned goodies as well as a garden salad for myself and a tuna sandwich for him. While we were eating, a guy sitting behind us gets up to walk towards the back (I'm guessing the restroom or maybe to grab some utensils), he stops right at our table, facing us (his pelvis was easily less than 6\" away from our table) and proceeds to cough right above my head and over my salad. Not just a dry normal cough - but the most disgusting phlegm filled cough ever. Did he cover his mouth? Sure, sort of in that half-assed way children do with a quick arm move. I was shocked and said \"Excuse me\" looking up at him. He goes, \"oh I covered my mouth though\". I was speechless while he walked away. One of the kind Porto's employees happened to walk by right after, his name was Cesar, and asked if we had any trash he could clear from our table - I grabbed some of the empty pastry plates and dirty napkins to give him and also handed him my quarter eaten (barely touched) salad. He asked if anything was wrong with it and I told him some guy walking by coughed on it so I've lost my appetite. Despite my insisting it was okay and not Porto's fault, Cesar was adamant on getting me a new salad and left for the kitchen.That same disgusting guy came walking back (because he was seated behind us) and instead of just continuing to his table, proceeded to badger me as he walked by - shouting some obscenities about how this is life, people cough, if I can't get over it I should never have kids and never leave the house again. REALLY? I mean REALLY? First of all, I wasn't even trying to have a conversation with this pig (the only thing I'd said the entire time prior was \"Excuse Me!\" at the beginning when this occurred) secondly, he never even apologized only throwing out a lame excuse saying he covered his mouth, thirdly, are you really trying to convince someone that you phlegm coughed on their food but that's life so they should eat it anyway? YOU'RE FREAKIN' KIDDING ME RIGHT? Well it was perfect timing because right as this repulsive ogre sits down at his table, STILL mumbling and grumbling about how I shouldn't be grossed out because again \"that's life\"... Cesar, the nice Porto's guy, comes by with my brand new salad, perfectly plated, and hands it to me saying \"please, enjoy this new one because that IS really disgusting.\" I should note that I don't think Cesar knew who was the cougher, he was just being incredibly considerate, but I do know that obnoxious culprit (and his friends sitting with him) heard the \"disgusting\" comment. Yes, sir, IT IS INDEED DISGUSTING TO COUGH OVER SOMEONES FOOD AT A RESTAURANT! Blehhh!Thank you again Cesar and Porto's as a whole :) for being classy, kind & considerate enough to insist on replacing my salad even though it wasn't your fault!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Sunny D.", "time": "7/30/2014"}, {"content": "Potato balls!!

Everything is good.I haven't tried everything-everything, yet, but every new thing I have tried has been consistently delicious. The food is just made well. For breakfast, my usual order is the guacamole and cheese croissant and a dulce de leche latte. And although I am in love with cheese rolls, because I try to stay low carb, I don't usually get any for me. Don't get me wrong; I still order at least 4 dozen every time I go (to give away to my friends), but I haven't had a cheese roll since April or May. Cray, right? My best friend got the mango cake once, and OH MY GOD I was in love. I decided to indulge, and I think I demolished half the entire cake in the span of about 2-3 days. Ugh, so good.2. Nothing is fancy. The food at Porto's tastes like and looks like home cooking. I love that Porto's has decided to keep the business small and limited (as opposed to franchised everywhere) because the quality can be maintained. But what I appreciate most about it is that the food is simple. Just simple, classic recipes. Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious. Just great food. AHHH, I just love that.3. The employees are amazing.Every employee I have ever encountered at Porto's has been extremely friendly and nice. I just LOVE interacting with everyone. But -- I do have a favorite -- Ricky! He's just so pleasant. I always like it when employees at an establishment are genuinely nice. Of course, that's a good reflection on each employee's personality and character, but I think it also shows that the business cares about its workers. I worked for Marriott for 4 years during college, and it was a company philosophy to treat employees well, so that they will treat clients well. And that has stuck with me all these years. As a side note, the BEST employees to interact with at Marriotts are the housekeepers, in my opinion. They're the nicest.Porto's will have my business forever and ever amen.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Patrice D.", "time": "9/28/2013"}, {"content": "My sister has been raving about Portos without ever having eaten at this place. I guess she read the awesome reviews from fellow Yelpers and heard about this place from co-workers while she was on a business trip. They didn't have time during their stay to check it out so... We took a family trip to So. Cal and she made Portos the first priority after landing in Burbank. Luckily my sis and the fam arrived about 45 minutes before us so they got to stand in line to order the food AND stand in line to be seated. I asked for the chorizo empanada and chicken empanadas. Unfortunately they ran out of chicken empanadas so we ordered a pork tamale and my brother ordered some pork sandwiches for us to try (one shredded pork and one cuban, I think it's called). The chorizo empanada was perfect! The pork tamale was seasoned well. The Cuban sandwich was delish and the shredded pork was so so... a little dry. They also picked up some bread pudding and flan. The flan was on point, the bread pudding was a cross between bread pudding and flan.. \u00a0IMO bread pudding should be a little dry and dense, this bread pudding was a little too wet/moist for me.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Mo G.", "time": "10/26/2014"}, {"content": "Crispity, crunchity potato balls!

I live within a mile of the bakery and it has always been packed. I drove past it for a few months before I decided to hey it a try. The parking lot is packed, but there's the option to valet. That was the first sign that there was something unique about this place. I entered in the caf\u00e9 and there are three lines. One for the caf\u00e9 sandwiches, and the other two for whole cakes and bakery items. I hardly remember standing in the very long bakery line; they took orders quickly. I stood mouth agape as I looked at my selection. I decided on \"The Opera\" and Carrot Cake. \"The Opera\" was very light despite its many layers. The texture was airy and smooth. The top chocolate layer was a nice touch. The Carrot Cake was equally delicious, Porto's did not stray from the classic cake too much. I did taste hints of what I think is pineapple. I may be wrong. I usually don't think many places live up to their hype, but I was shocked as Porto's far exceeded my expectations.
