[{"content": "The food deserves a 4 star. But the service brought it down to a 3 star rating. Waiting in line is a given but the rudeness from some of the staff is unacceptable. It was my first time at Portos and as a fellow bakery owner and Cuban I was not happy with the service offered. After waiting for 15-20 minutes, I was greeted by Brenda. She took my order. Everything I wanted was in stock and in the show case. (Meat pie empanadas, NY cheesecake and Guava pastry) and she was able to check that the potato balls were in fact in stock and ready. The problem started the moment I was at the register. She brought my order and told me that there were no more guava pastries. I was surprised because when I placed my order with her there were two full trays. She told me that it is based off when people place their orders and somebody ordered all of them. That it was basically my timing, but when I told her I had obviously witnessed 2 full trays when I ordered she had nothing to say. It was ridiculous to me that her service was so slow that she was occupied doing whatever it was she was doing that she couldn't grab my order in a timely matter. With that being said I asked her if there were any coming out or if she checked the other side and she brushed me off and walked away. Which is when the cashier, Arlene H, took over in being rude. She rang me up and I told her I thought this was ridiculous because I had been waiting and came just for these pastries. She had the nerve to talk back in a rude manner saying that others have been waiting all morning and didn't get what they wanted. (I would suspect in a high volume business, you would have a high supply of what's being demanded). I did not appreciate the attitude I was being given in my time of frustration. As a bakery owner I have always told my employees that the customers needs come first and you handle negative encounters calmly. That we as the employees never want to belittle our customers. She could have politely apologized for the inconvenience, but neither her or Brenda apologized. My boyfriend then approached another worker by the name of Patrick and asked to speak to the manager. He calmly asked what the problem was and I told him my issue. He assured me that he will go to the back and check to see if there are any available (wether it was with cream cheese or not I didn't have a preference). He came back with a box full of what I initially ordered and rang me up. He was very professional and his customer service rated at a 5. I acknowledged and thanked him for his service and actually doing his job. The compassion he has for this company's customers is the type that everybody on the work force needs to have. The fact that neither of those girls took 2 minutes out of their time to ensure that we as customers were satisfied truly disgusted me. My hat is off to Patrick.
