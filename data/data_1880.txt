[{"content": "Spacious restaurant, delicious and reasonably priced food, but it takes sooo long to get through the line! \u00a0I feel like there's got to be a more efficient way to order a sandwich than to wait in the pastry line for an hour. \u00a0I like the steak torta and the pan con bistec. \u00a0The pan con bistec comes with fried potato sticks that I think I used to eat out of a can as a little kid; it's an interesting addition to a sandwich. \u00a0I also like their desserts and pastries. \u00a0I try different things when I go in, and I always enjoy it.

Love love love their Guava Pastries (with and without cheese)If you are in the LA area, you have to try this place. \u00a0Came here on my visit to Socal and the long line to get these pastries were well worth it.
