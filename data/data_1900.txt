It was a full house if course. I just ended up getting just a cake only instead of some other pastries. The guy gave me a triple chocolate mousse from the back(the kitchen). Didn't know it was newly cook. We just figured that out cause it started dripping from the box soon as we got in the car. So I let it sit in the fridge for hours. When we were ready to eat it it was soggy as hell. It was all mushed. Even the \"cake\" on the bottom turned out to be moussey. So disappointed. The weird thing is. There were some chocolate mousse sitting in their fridge behind the counter. But it was a walk from where the server was. I guess he took the shorter way to get the mousse which is their kitchen. But they served it right away without letting it settle.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Yzen D.", "time": "2/2/2016"}, {"content": "Can't get better than Portos!

At least so far... haha Portos is amazing. I've haven't ate at the restaurant portion but I've picked up some pastries from them. They have a private lot you can park at.There often will be a line so expect to wait a bit but it is well worth it. The same helper that boxes your pastries will be the one ringing you up, I kind of like that because the person in front of you might take forever while you're only trying to pick up a few items.No matter what, if it's your first time, you MUST get Guava Rolls, Potato Balls, and Cheese Rolls.

And now I remember why I should make monthly trips to LA - for all of the foods obviously. I mean...potato balls? Delicious cuban sandwiches? Dulce de Leche Kisses? My god, what have they done to me. Please just go and get a potato ball or 15. Especially if you're at the Conan show, it's the perfect time to go once they let you go to lunch (~1-1:30pm). Also, the guava shake was BOMB. Do yourself a favor and go there. Right now. Unless it's like lunch rush or something, cause then the line can get a little ridiculous. But you should still go. Probably. Most likely.

I dig the plantain chips that they serve with their sandwiches.The potato balls are definitely a must, followed by the cheese rolls. Their desserts are all delicious, but I'm still bummed that they changed the mango mousse a while back because the original was bomb.

It is ALWAYS crowded and a little intimidating upon entry but well worth the wait. The place is buzzing, and my anticipation grows as I shuffle through line. It always seems to move faster than I think it will, and I can't focus on my order because I am mesmerized by a pastry case the length of a football field. Porto's runs like clockwork. A staff member is never far to direct lost souls to the shortest lines or help you find a table.I have ordered cakes from here a couple times for special occasions. The berries and cream cake is heavenly. Let me tell you that nobody is disappointed to see a Porto's box in your hands when you arrive at the party.
