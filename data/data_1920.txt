Home of the infamous potato balls and cheese rolls Porto's is more than just these two treats. Producing a number of desserts and breads on a daily basis, it's safe to say whatever you get here is #1 delicious #2 fresh, fresh, fresh. For my visit I of course got my go to cheese rolls - basically, it's a turnover with sugar and filled with cream cheese. Normally I never get more than just my dozen, but decided to change things up and try something new. For those something new, I got their: fruit tart, strawberry shortcake, strawberry cupcake, strawberry and cream cheese filled croissant. While I don't think I have to describe what any of these desserts are, I will say I THOROUGHLY enjoyed every single one. All of their desserts are not overwhelmingly sweet and best of all when you get your purchase they're nice and warm.

For a couple of bucks you can get a giant mixed bag of day old pastries - a total bargain. \u00a0They are not stale or anything and they usually sell out before noon. Their cuban sandwiches are very good, although a bit small. \u00a0I really like their avocado egg omelette croissant sandwich. \u00a0Their potato balls border on addictive.I wouldn't say Porto's has the best baked goods around, but you get a lot for what you pay for.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Hion L.", "time": "6/20/2014"}, {"content": "Love this place!!

I ordered the Ropa Vieja - Cuban style shredded beef sando with bells onions olives and tomato sauce on Cuban sweet bread, the line didn't take very long, the sando came out quick and I found a table outside to enjoy it. Enjoy it I did, unique and tasty, only gripe was that it seemed a little small, but I feel that way about every place I go. I'll be back to try the rest.

Peanut butter cookie - not great. Napoleon - realllly good but messy! All hopes of saving half for later were crushed when I tried cutting it :(Individual spiced bundt cake (white icing) - pretty dry. The icing flaked off as soon as I cut it. Chocolate chip cookie - not amazing, you could skip it. I think here it's best to stick to the things everyone else has mentioned - cheese puffs, carrot cake, guava cheese rolls, etc. Those really are the best. Get anything else and you'll end up feeling like you cheated yourself!!Edit: spiced bundt cake actually tasted better the next day, after sitting in the fridge all night..Also note, cakes from here DO belong in the fridge. Some cakes (e.g. Sprinkles) are better left outside since they dry quickly, but Porto's cakes are moist enough that you should keep them in the fridge, and take them out a while before you eat.

Luckily, turnover and service is fast so tables open up quickly. \u00a0Our selection:Potato ball - their famous item and so good. \u00a0At only $0.90 each, you deserve a few of the fried potato balls of goodness filled with minced meat. Chicken croquette - batter is filled with creamy chicken and spices and deep fried. Also $0.90 and great for an appetizer. Cubano sandwich - tasty ham, pork and cheese sandwich on great bread. \u00a0If theres one criticism, it's that the sandwich wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese fully. Great value though at under $5, like most sandwiches here. Mushroom soup - made fresh daily and with great fresh mushrooms. \u00a0So good we got two more orders. Horchata Smoothie - delicious as it sounds. Fast, delicious, and affordable, it's easy to see why Porto's is so popular. \u00a0The potato balls are as good as advertised and everything else is fresh and tasty. \u00a0I don't know how they have this quality at this price, but it's a winning formula.
