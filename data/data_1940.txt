[{"content": "Great potato balls!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Christina G.", "time": "7/14/2015"}, {"content": "I've eaten everything here that I can (so no pork and no beef) and everything is fantastic. I get the torta de pollo, chicken sandwich or chicken milanesa 2-3x a week and I'll happily keep coming back as long as they let me. And a $.79 cheese roll is always a fantastic snack, chocolate croissants are also incredible... I mean it's really all great. And the price is killer - it's priced like fast food but all fresh, delicious and relatively (relatively!) healthy. The only \"knock\" is that they are often so busy and have so many people waiting for tables that there just isn't time to clean up tables and chairs (and floors) in time for the next available party. They have an army of very efficient, very polite staff working all the time (I counted 30 people working last time I was in), and there's a whole squadron of workers with brooms and wash cloths - I don't have an answer for how to make everything a touch cleaner (it has more to do with customers' lack of patience than Porto's lack of attention to this matter), but I have made that observation in the past.But all of that said, I can't recommend them enough!!TIPS:- Drinks Only Line: if you just want an iced coffee and don't want to wait the 20 minutes during the lunch rush, there is a special line to the left of the barista stand where you can skip ahead of everyone ordering sandwiches and potato balls.- Catering: I am having them provide the food for a party and it's going to be incredible. Regarding price, for reference, their large salad feeds up to 32 for $30, Tender Greens feeds 10 for $55. Crazy!- Wedding Cakes: Portos in Glendale did our wedding cake - it was 1/2 the price of anything close and utterly gorgeous, great tasting, and a super easy ordering process.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jonathan J.", "time": "7/14/2015"}, {"content": "Yummy pastries! \u00a0Their cheese rolls are my favorite. \u00a0Their sandwiches are just okay though, nothing too special. \u00a0Service is fast and friendly.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Samantha C.", "time": "10/28/2013"}, {"content": "Porto's is amazing!

I DIED & WENT TO HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My West Coast friends/hosts had been raving about this place, apparently there is no 'down time', there is ALWAYS a line and they have the BEST baked goods and breakfast/lunch EVER! So....one morning I decided that they should take me so I can see what all the fuss is about. They were right, there was a line....in fact TWO. The good thing is the lines were moving fairly fast as the staff take care of customers very efficiently. In the background behind the display counters I could see staff rushing around with trays of items.....they were constantly replacing & refreshing their stock. People walking out with boxed of goods & cakes etc.....ok definitely very popular, I'll give them that. The ambiance is a casual cafe style space, though quite large.As we got closer I read through the menu to decide what I wanted. They have a really good selection of breakfast & lunch items and it was a bit of a struggle to pick one. And then I saw the display of all the sweets & decadent goodies! Visually.....total FOOD PORN!!!!! (see pictures)We got some of the Meat-Stuffed Potato Croquettes (YUMMMMY) and I got the Avocado omelet on croissant. Also......for later to satisfy my sweet tooth I grabbed a Flourless chocolate cake - pure decadence and tasted EVERY BIT as good as it looked. The food was SO FRESH it was amazing. While ordering we could see all the breads and croissants and could tell they were constantly make fresh ones. AMAZING! My friends had a birthday cake leftover from a few days ago that they had frozen for me and even THAT was SO yummy.If you're visiting the area, this is a MUST!

Last time we tried their pumpkin cheesecake and we were not disappointed. Their pastries are some of the best I have had in the area and the long lines definitely speak to that.

They have delicious horchata and mamey smoothies as well as orange juice and even more coffee/espresso selections.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Cristi C.", "time": "11/27/2014"}, {"content": "Delicious on top of delicious. The classic Cubano sandwich with a side of fried plantains, large horchata, and a few (or five) guava and cheese pastries for dessert = my perfect meal. Absolutely love this place and yes it is always busy, but rightfully so, and even then the line moves at a good pace, with staff working so efficiently, you won't even notice the wait with all the samples offered. I have ordered birthday cakes for my kids from here, the mango one and then the tres leches one to be exact, and both were a hit across the board-from adult to child. It is not a fancy restaurant you would dress to the nines for, with seating so sparse and jammed close together, but my whole family loves coming here, despite the wait, the chair hunting, and the 20 minutes it takes to find parking. The food is that good. I even sneak over on my lunch break to cheat my diet and have just one cheese pastry. And a horchata to go, why not. Also, bringing a box full of their sweets to an office meeting, kid's soccer game, or on a suprise visit to my parents, will bring smiles and is honestly a lovely treat. And introducing newbies to Portos' deliciousness always converts more adicts. I am practically an unsponsered promoter and I love it. I have yet to order something I don't want to eat ten more of, and look forward to trying the whole menu.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Heidi D.", "time": "2/24/2016"}, {"content": "This place is still the same, which in this case is not a bad thing at all. Everything was fresh, the OJ still pretty tasty and satisfying. I left a nice tip and enjoyed my snack of potato balls, cheese rolls, and guava strudel... not all at once.The danger of this place is that it can be habit forming, thankfully there are none too close to us, yet. So i'm upping my previous review by one star because perhaps that's the way to deal with Portos, in small portions and sporadic visits...

The guy served my friends, and then moved on to other people.I stood there for awhile, and then asked the server if he was free. He made a joke that he WISHES he was free. Not funny when I'm trying to get food...He then told me to go stand in line, I told him I had been in line, but was accidentally skipped.Did he believe me? No. And after a few seconds of rude banter of telling me how I should go back in line, I gave up and got a manager.I was mainly upset because when he asked the other person (who served my friends and SAW ME in line), he denied it.Gee how professional...Sorry Porto's, I can get Cuban pastries elsewhere from now on.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Ariel S.", "time": "6/11/2014"}, {"content": "I visited Porto in Downey,, I was very disappointed on their service..

I could make a meal out of just the little starters. The potato ball, chorizo pie, and tamale (which I've never liked elsewhere) are all delicious and cheap! You could easily get 5 items for $5 and be completely full after. And the sandwiches are also reasonably priced, although, not as mind blowingly delicious as those savory pastries.I live dangerously close to Porto's so luckily there are a few deterrents to keep me from going everyday. For one, the parking is a nightmare. The lot is tiny and packed, and since it's always busy having trouble finding a spot is pretty much guaranteed. Additionally, the line inside is torturous. Especially if you're already hungry when you go. And finally, finding seating is also a huge pain.
