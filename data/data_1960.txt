The prices are fantastic for the quality and servers were busy, but nice.** Potato Balls (Papas Rellenas de Picadillo) - Fresh or To Go. Either way, you win with these small fried soft Mashed Potato balls filled with Ground Beef. 5/5** Meat Pies (Pastel de Carne) - Flaky Crust, Fluffy Pastry. Meaty Magic, Get some for the road. 5/5** Cubano Sandwich - Che Guevara would be proud of this hero loaded with Roasted Pork, Ham, and Swiss Cheese on Cuban Bread . 4.5/5** Potato Ball Sandwich (Papa Preparada) - Is the same Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Mustard/Mayo mix on Cuban bread as the Cubano except those addictive Potato Balls play the meat role. 4/5** Steak Fajita Sandwich - Warm with Guacamole and Veggies. The Provolone and French Bread practically turns it into a Mexican Cheese Steak. 3/5Oh, and I loved the Mariquitas (homemade Plantain Chips) that came free with each sandwich.

Nope, it was because I went one Saturday a few weeks ago and had THE crummiest experience. \u00a0Boo! \u00a0First of all, the more I go, the more I'm realizing that the people behind the counter are just.. not very friendly. :/ Maybe it's because they can barely hear me. \u00a0But no, almost no one ever smiles. \u00a0And that's saying a LOT because there are a LOT of people working there. \u00a0Ok, I can handle that if I'm going to get some cheese rolls, but Saturday's experience I can NOT handle. \u00a0My 2 friends and I went to get some grub. \u00a0We spent close to $40 on hot foods, desserts, and a \"dinner plate.\" \u00a0The plate was mine, and I got it in a to-go box in case I didn't finish it, so I wouldn't have to hunt down someone to give me a box (because customer service here is LACKING for sure). \u00a0So, it's busy there, as usual, but we head over to find a table to sit, not noticing that a few people are in a makeshift \"line\" with their table numbers in hand. \u00a0We snag a table, but are told by an employee that we have to wait in line with our numbers. \u00a0Oh, okay, we say.. but hey, we don't have a number. We got our order in a to-go box, thus a lack of number. \u00a0Ooooooo, says the employee.. Well, THIS TIME we can have a table, but NEXT TIME, in order to be able to sit down there, we can't get to-go, we NEED to have a legit number. \u00a0WHAAA? \u00a0I cannot even begin to handle what this unfriendly lady's saying. \u00a0We just dropped 40 bucks, and you're telling us we can't sit here, you're doing us a favor letting us sit here? \u00a0WHA?!?! \u00a0And then, warn us that next time you will NOT be so \"nice,\" basically? \u00a0Oh hell no. \u00a0This turned us all off sooo much, we almost hightailed it out of here. \u00a0I've never, EVER gone anywhere, spent that much money, and been told we can't sit in the restaurant/cafe/whatever. \u00a0EVER. \u00a0EVERRR. \u00a0If this is a new policy, get rid of it, because I'm sure I'm not the only one who experienced this and was turned off by it. \u00a0Stupid idea. \u00a0That being said, this was the first time I had the dinner plate, and it was HORRIBLE. \u00a0It had chicken (which was completely flavorless and cold), fried plantains (pretty greasy), beans (which were good), rice (just regular rice) and cost wayy too much for what it was. \u00a0Not only did I finish it, but I was left hungry. \u00a0So much for the to-go box! \u00a0Bad experience + POOR customer service + cold/bad food = I WILL be thinking twice about giving them my business. \u00a0I will go back to Porto's for cheese rolls (probably), but I will think more than twice about going to eat sandwiches and cafe stuff there, lest I should run into the same situation that turned me off so much that fateful Saturday that ruined a good amount of my 15 year old obsession with Porto's. \u00a0Too bad. :/ \u00a0Porto's management, please recognize that if your food was not delicious overall, your customer service would probably stand out even more as being poor/lacking/non existent. \u00a0I have almost never encountered a friendly server, and I come here all the time. \u00a0They're not all necessary UNFRIENDLY. \u00a0They are just not FRIENDLY, and there is a HUGE difference. \u00a0It's not just enough to coast along on your popularity and mostly tasty food. \u00a0I want more - I want a genuine smile once in a while. \u00a0And the INTERESTING thing is that I found no \"contact us\" link on their website. \u00a0What?! \u00a0How?? \u00a0How do you not want feedback on your store/food/website? \u00a0I may be mistaken, but I looked everywhere and didn't find it. \u00a0I just find that interesting! \u00a0Most restaurants with such volume have a contact us link clearly displayed, but maybe they just don't want to be bothered.UPDATE: Shortly after I sent my review/suggestion to the Porto's Facebook page, I received a nice reply from management, addressing my concerns. \u00a0Just hope that they can change their policy, and educate their staff so that I can go back to loving Porto's. \u00a0Hehe. :)", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Em H.", "time": "7/19/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "OMG this place is the bomb....Growing up in Miami, Ive definitely had my fair share of Cuban food- both savory and sweet- so when a friend of mine talked me into a trip to Burbank for Portos, I initially went in with some reluctance... and SHAME ON ME!When we arrived, I was delighted to learn this location had its own parking lot, (definite plus) and when we walked in, it was larger than I expected, with plenty of sitting room for patrons!Luckily, the line was rather short, so we quickly zipped in and ordered:Guava Pastries: AMAZING- just like Miami, with that sweet filling inside the light buttery crust pastry! 5/5 stars!
