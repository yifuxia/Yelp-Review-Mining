I waited about 15 minutes in line till it was my turn. I guess I came at a good time cause by the time I finished picking out my goodies, the line was LONGGGGGGGGGG. Before the trip to Portos, a few of my co-workers recommeded the cheese balls and potato balls. I am NOT a fan of cheese. I hate cheese. But when I took one bite into those balls (haha, thats what she said), it was amazing!! The crust was sweet and flaky. And as for the potato balls, it was stuffed with deliciousness!!

I normally don't visit Portos, actually I think this is my first time in like 10 years buying something from here but wanted to buy a last minute birthday cake and stopped in about 1pm on a Saturday and It was crazy, 4 different lines and I wasn't sure if I was in the right line and I just started to follow where others gathered wishing it the right line, lol (luckily I was). I felt like I was at Disneyland waiting for a ride but was very surprised how fast the line was moving. In about 5 min we were already shouting our order to the lady across the counter.
