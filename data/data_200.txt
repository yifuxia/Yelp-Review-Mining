The line was two rows long. This is quite a business. They're making BANK!!! There are two sections: food and bakery. The food was good, but it's inefficiently run; if you're sitting at a table, the busboys bringing your food and drinks for you take forever, and they have to walk around the entire place to get to you, which is just, and I repeat, inefficient! Anyway, list of things we got is below. I personally loved the chicken croquettes, and thought the pastrami sandwich and tuna melts were good, not great.

The wait was about 15-20 minutes which isn't bad for a popular SoCal joint.We ordered a lot of food, the bakery service was very prompt and friendly but the wait for the hot sandwich was a bit on the long side. -Croquette and potato ball were mediocre.. needed more filling and for the same price I've had potato balls twice as large and much more flavorful and thus more satisfying. The chicken one was very dry and needed more seasoning on the chicken. The beef had an ok amount of seasoning but needed more of the filling in the ball itself.-Meat pie's crust was perfectly flaky but.. it was sweet.. which is off putting.-Guava cheese pastry was the only dish that was very flavorful.. very guava-y! So you better like guava when you bite into it. -Cheese roll pastry.. its flaky crust is sweet and flakey.. but I couldn't taste the cheese at all.. rather disappointing.-Mango chunks pastry.. completely meh. The chunks of fruit were distinct and very syrupy.. I believe they use fresh mangos but then they must have dunked the fruit into simple syrup for hours.The dough and relatively inexpensive prices for the bakery goods were my favorite parts. But all things considered they are VERY stingy with the fillings.Overall the food is good and I can see why it's popular but I'm not a huge fan of the food.

Virtually everything here is fresh and tasty, We recently stopped by for some breakfast pastries and I was surprised by the low prices! No wonder this place is packed and does such a huge business. A lot of their treats are only about a dollar or less, so its easy to bring home a big gold box-full and still have change from your 10 spot!Some of my favorites include the coconut strudel, the guava strudel, the mango smoothie, and the chocolate brownie. Somebody has a sweet tooth!Don't worry about the long lines - they go pretty fast. Because the shop has limited seating (they actually have lots of seating, but always seem to have more customers than seats), they will gladly box things up for you so you can take them home or to a nearby park.Porto's sandwiches are also top shelf. I have only had the chicken sandwich, so can't really comment on anything else, although seeing other peoples' choices leads me to conclude that everything they make is really great. The chicken sandwich was exactly as I expected - the chicken was fresh and moist and the bread (of course) was as good as it gets.I am glad that I don't live near Porto's Bakery & Cafe or I would end up eating here constantly!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Vin S.", "time": "9/7/2015"}, {"content": "Tried potato balls, fried plantain, cubano, chicken empanadas, coffee con leche and guava cheese pastry.
