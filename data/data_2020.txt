Finally, made it down to Socal after a couple years and of course, within a few hours of landing, we were at this Porto's.We were intimidated by the line at first, but it moved really fast. \u00a0They really got their system down. I don't even like cheesey type pastries, but WOW that was damn good!! \u00a0Delish!!! We also ordered the guava rolls, but we preferred the cheese rolls. \u00a0We also had one potato ball, though we should've had more. Everything was fantastic. I'd give 5 stars for the pastries alone. \u00a0We ended up having lunch here and ordered a ropa vieja sandwich and a pork sandwich, that we just thought were ok. \u00a0My ropa vieja was better than the pork one - and that is the reason for the 4 stars.Looks like Porto's will be a must hit each time we are in Socal.....", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Dawn D.", "time": "9/19/2013"}, {"content": "This place has good food and pastries and is dirt cheap ,I mean where in town can you get a sandwich for 5 bucks . The one and major downside is that there are always lines ,but they move pretty quickly. The cheese strudels are amazing and cost like 75 cents a piece .

The Carrot cake is my fave!Sandwiches are also great; my faves are the Cubano and Medianoche. Love going on the weekends, but that's the busiest time with long lines; however, the wait is worth it.

The selection was limited, but the quality was outstanding. \u00a0The pastries were very fresh and made by hand. The potato balls were to die for. Although I applaud the hard work the family has put into the business, it seems to lack the atmosphere of the past. We used to be able to go in and order our pastry and chat with Betty, the owners daughter. Now when you go into portos, \u00a0your barely greeted by an employee with a headset on directing you to which line to go to. The lines are long!!! We ordered our pastry and of course my potato balls. The potato balls are still yummy, but the pastry really lacked the flavor that is used to have. So much effort used to be put into each dessert, and now it just seems like it's made for the masses. \u00a0It's not the Portos that I knew and loved. Many people know portos now for being the cool and hip place and won't understand what I'm talking about, \u00a0but the ones that grew up with it will certainly undersrand. Lack of stars because the employees are like robots, the pastry lacks passion, \u00a0and the atmosphere feels like we are a herd of animals.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Rita S.", "time": "10/13/2015"}, {"content": "Porto's is such an awesome place.

Sure the line is long but it moves fast and it's kind of nice to have the extra time to figure out exactly what I want to order (since it's never just one or two things!) Feta sandwich on multigrain is my favorite, with a chicken empanada, a mango smoothie, a cheese roll, and a cheesecake.
