The strawberry cake with whipcream and yadda yadda was fantastic. I was excited and had decided that Porto's would be the place I'd purchase my son's first birthday cake. Everything was perfect, the cake LOOKED fantastic...all month long I was bragging about the cake being a Porto's cake. The guests at the party were excited to try the cake I was raving about...but then I was met with probably the BIGGEST disappointment of my life. The cake was SO DRY. My first thought was \"maybe it'll get better.\" It didn't. The cake wasn't fresh at all. It tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge since the day I ordered it, which was two weeks in advance. There weren't any of the flavors that I had experienced with the first Porto's cake. It was dry. It was horrible. I nearly cried, because I had spent $70 on half a sheet of what's supposed to be a fantastic cake only to get something even my LOCAL GROCERY STORE COULD DO BETTER. I could have purchased 3 cakes at the price for the Portos cake and gotten a better quality, and I couldn't believe it. So I complained. What did they do to \"make it up to me?\" \"$30 off your next cake.\" Are you fucking kidding me!? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. I PAID YOU TO DO A GOOD JOB ON SOMETHING YOU SPECIALIZE IN, YOU MESSED UP AND YOU STILL TAKE MY MONEY!? UNBELIEVABLE!!!Never, in my LIFE, have I EVER been so disappointed about ANYTHING like I have been with this. I can't stress how upset I was over this. I can't believe you have the audacity to say \"oh, try us again, we'll give you $30 off.\" I DON'T WANT TO TRY YOU AGAIN. How could YOU do this to a new mom just trying to make the best for her son?! The woman whom you have as your ICON, Mrs. Porto herself, would be disappointed in you.What did I do with the 2/3rds of cake left? I threw it in the trash, where it belonged. Hell, even my garbage can deserved better than the SHIT cake they gave me. I paid $70 for them to basically shit on the 1/2 sheet cake that they gave me. I sincerely hope that you rethink how you treat your customers, Portos. Never again will I purchase from you, and never again will I recommend you to friends.

The outside is really nice and made the neighborhood corner look a lot more elegant. \u00a0However, the acoustics inside are terrible. \u00a0When it is busy and it is always busy, you feel like you have to shout to everyone; the person taking your order, the cashier and worst of all, the person you are eating with. \u00a0The prices are fantastic. \u00a0Cheapest place in town to eat a good mean. \u00a0Croissant sandwiches make the perfect lunch. \u00a0If you like puff pastry, you will love it. \u00a0There isn't a lot of variety in the variety.

Porto's is a one-stop destination for pastries, cakes, sandwiches and cafe-style smoothies, coffee and other drinks.Ambiance:-large, open, with cafe-style seating-busy, specifically during the lunch hours (12-2)-unsure about table service, everyone I saw was waiting in a lineFood:-we ordered potato balls, chocolate croissants and ham and cheese croissants-potato balls were DELICIOUS, but I can't imagine eating more than one. It's basically a deep-fried/breaded ball of mashed potatoes with a beef chili filling.-chocolate croissants (per my friend) were really tasty and definitely fresh-ham and cheese croissants were very greasy, a bit bland. They were the last ones from the morning batch, may taste better fresh.Altogether, Porto's is surprisingly inexpensive for the quality of what you're getting. Several customers were a little out-of-hand, but the staff handled their issues beautifully.
