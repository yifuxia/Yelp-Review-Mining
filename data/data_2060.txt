My favorite ones have to be the blueberry muffin, red velvet cupcake and cheese rolls. And the cakes are delightful.

Even though Porto's is a Cuban (I believe) bakery, they can definitely compete with us Germans. They literally have everything, from carrot cake, croissants, some South American treats, cookies, sandwiches, etc. I always get my birthday cakes from there as well. Porto's doesn't make them so \"sugary\" as the usual American bakery. One thing to complain about it the \"wait time\". On a weekend it can easily be 30 minutes, but they are very organized and do everything they can for great and quick service. The prices are great and I only pay like $3 for a great multigrain bread compared to a $10 loaf from La Brea Bakery.

Always worth the wait. Every time I come in, I feel like I am entering the candy room at the Wonka factory. The staff is always super nice and helpful. But if you plan accordingly, you won't have to.

They are the best comfort foods EVEER. the potato balls are about a 2-2.5 inches in diameter, costs only 90cents and is filled with creamy mash potatoes and juicy ground beef. The cheese rolls sound gross, but they're soo delicious! It's a creamy cheese, like, sweet cream cheese on a red velvet cupcake (i don't know how to describe it!) and it's in a thick flaky pastry! YUM. I bought a dozen of each (bc there are none in nor cal) and brought it home for my family and friends. They loved it! So seriously just try them. I've also tried their white chocolate raspberry cake. sounds yummy right? It IS. It was the best cheesecake my family's ever tasted. I bought a whole cheesecake, brought it with me to the airport and sat with it the entire time on the plane ride home and it was totally worth it. The overdecorated cake (they put a flurry of solid, thin white chocolate stuff on the top. see the photos i've added!) and looked like it was worth $50 but really it was around $27!! :O omg are you kidding me!? that's such a steal for such a good cake! All the other cakes are so nicely decorated as wellThis place is CROWDED \u00a0but it's a HUGE bakery ... with an eating area that's always crowded . and there not many places to park.. soo.. expect some delays.

Ordered the famous Cheese Rolls and Potato ball. LOVE the cheese rolls. It's not too sweet or too overwhelming, it was just delightful! I can see why people love it so much. The potato ball on the other hand was too much for me. It's doughy and a mouthful BUT the filling, oh my god the filling made up for it. So savory and hearty, I can see why people would love it because it's filling and warms you up. My sister, a potato fanatic, loved it. I ended up ordering a bunch to-go due to friend's request. Lucky me, the to-go order consisted of freshly baked cheese rolls! So GOOD. The red velvet cupcake also called my name, so I got that too. Ate it the next day and it was still so moist!

Say no more. I'm sold.There are very few places that sell guava flavored things and even fewer that gets it right. Portos definitely gets it right. From their guava cheese rolls to their guava smoothies, everything is made to perfection.Aside from my guava craze, I also enjoy other bakery items and there are so many to choose from. Every time I go, I'm hoping that while I wait in line, I can decide which pastries I want, but it never works out... I'm always still in a state of indecision when I'm helped. Needless to say, it doesn't matter what you choose in the end. The food is always delicious. I definitely prefer the pastries over the sandwiches but the sandwiches aren't bad at all either (and they're served with a side of fried plantains). Those potato balls though... those are a must. In terms of service, Portos is great. While the line may seem intimidating when you first enter, you'll reach the counter in no time. The service is super efficient and while you wait in line, they often give you samples of smoothies or cakes which makes the time go by even faster (while you're trying to decide what you want to get).Finally, the price. It's great. It's ridiculous how cheap these high quality pastries are and there's free parking in the back!! Win-win situation.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Naomi S.", "time": "8/23/2013"}]
