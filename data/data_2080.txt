I heard from friends and TV that this is the best bakery around. I got there early to beat the crowds. Its not bad of a wait if you are there close to its opening hours. You definitely see this line getting longer. My eyes lit up when I saw all the pastries and fresh bread. I probably ordered and ate more than I normally would. I felt some of the sweeter pastries were pretty normal. The savory items were very good. The Chicken croquette and Potato ball are a must if you come here. I also had a smoothie and I thought that was super sweet. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to this bakery.Best thing about this place is the excellent prices and their interesting pastries. I don't know if I will go out of my way to come back, but if it close by I will definitely try it again. At the end of this visit, I was Portos out. Careful with the low costs.

No sweat though, Porto's employees are friendly, fast, efficient and won't \"Soup Nazi\" you out of the line. \u00a0This fried potato ball everyone keeps raving about was good but since it was hyped up so much I had unrealistic expectations. It's not mind blowing enough to make me come back solely for that purpose but I'm not opposed to order a couple to scarf down while I wait for the rest of my order. My sister got the Caprese sandwich that I was eyeing but since we have a strict no double ordering policy in the family I resorted to my second choice. The Caprese wasn't bad, you can really never go wrong with fresh tomato and mozzarella, but it didn't hit my savory tooth as I was expecting. In the end the jokes on her because the Steak fajita was the top dog of our lunch. Hot and juicy with a bit of crunch from the bell peppers and completely hunger sating.

Every time I visit Porto's, it's pretty much packed - seats, line (be ready to stand for about 10 minutes to order). But I'm usually fine with that, I order and wait outside as they also have seats along the sidewalk.The rest is great: sandwiches are big, fresh and tasty, the order itself comes pretty quick, I expected to wait more minding the number of people ordering. Staff is friendly, I got a free coffee refill (regular sized cup is only 1.39, by the way). Once I've visited Porto's close to 8, when they were about to close, and a waiter came up to me with a paper bag and asked if I wanted to take some free bread, as they didn't sell it today and they obviously won't leave it for tomorrow. That was totally unexpected and very nice of them! Prices are great - it only around $7-8 for a coffee and a sandwich that could easily feed a grown man, I sometimes eat only half and take the other half home, that's how big they are. Plus they serve them with crispy plantain chips, which makes the meal even bigger. Ah.
