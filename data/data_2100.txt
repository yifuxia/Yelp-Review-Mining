I mean I've ordered them hoping that it was a one time thing, maybe they came out extra puffy in that batch? But nope. Next few times I ordered, my hopes have been let down. I've had portos ever since I was little. I grew up with the Glendale location, then when I moved, I now go to the Burbank one. I don't know if it's just the Burbank location, but the cheese rolls have gotten puffier and there's less cheese filling. I heard it's because they use a machine to make them? Is using a machine really worth the crappy quality? QUALITY VS. QUANTITY. Isn't that what portos should stand for? I mean it is an authentic Cuban cafe. I was hoping they would stick to their amazing quality. But sadly I was wrong. Portos, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your cheese rolls!!! I am very disappointed.

The lines moves relatively fast! You'll be in and out of there in no time :)MUST GET:1. guava cheese roll: This is a little piece pastry heaven. I really love it. I like the guava fruit in the pastry because it adds a nice fruity sweetness to the pastry that compliments the silky sweet cheese! The pastry was buttery and flaky. It was so good, and it's only 80 cents. I get about like 6 each time :)2. cheese roll: I really like their cheese. It's nice and sweet. super creamy but not in a sickening way. It's addicting :3 I LOVE IT. plain and simple!3. CHICKEN EMPANADAS: this is what i'm craving from this place ALL THE TIME. of all their empanadas this one is it. Whatever they put in the empanada is so gooood. It's really tasty! The seasoning they use is perfect :')4. Potato balls: this is everyone's favorite. I like it. I'm not that big of a fan of potatoes but this is really good. If you're craving something salty and savory definitely get this. It's one fried ball of deliciousness.Every time I go here, I always leave with 2-3 boxes of food.
