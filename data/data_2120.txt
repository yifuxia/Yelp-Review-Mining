I told myself if I see Porto's I'm going. Which I did.. (not to familiar with Burbank). Parking in the back was crazy packed. None at all. Street parking was very limited. Came after breakfast crowd.. before lunch crowd.. around 11am. I guess that's a good time to go. No line on cafe side. But of course crazy line in bakery side. I was just there to grab sammie, balls, croquette & of course my favorite cortadito w/ sugar.. double please. Placed my order with Ester. She was cool but took my order 3 times and even threw me off. Which I did not hear she said 1 Cuban sammie. (Poor hubby) got everything right except that. Realized that I was missing a sammie when I picked up my order. Cause the other worker said 4 sandwich and I was like huh OK then looked at my receipt and said shit. I would grab another but saw the line and said F' IT. I'm going home. So any-who the sammies are great. Haven't had a ham & cheese croissant in a long time, it was delish. Cortadito oh so good. Will be awake late. So all in all if you want get Cuban food get there Around 10:30am after and before rush. Good luck in parking and finding a table. Triple check your order when she repeats.

The original location is in Glendale on Brand, and I have never been there. But I have been to this one in Burbank two dozen times. It is packed full of people and energy. I love it. And I always leave feeling that I under paid for what I got, which is rare.Primarily this is a pastry and gourmet coffee place, and secondarily a Cuban restaurant. I love both elements. The place is huge, with a dining area, and two enormous ordering areas that also have tables. Each ordering area has lines like security at an airport: and for good reason. The cases are filled with cakes, popovers, muffins, pastries, and also savory Cuban pies. You can also order off of the menus on the wall: Cuban sandwiches, salads, breakfast, and more. I have tried most of the dishes and all of them are good, not great, but good.Try the potato and chicken croquettes, and the rope beef sandwich. Also the pastries are amazing for the price, (many less than a dollar). Look at them and choose. They are cheap, so pick six.

The sandwiches were good, starting with great bread and quality ingredients. Medianoche was good, but my pan con bistec was hearty and tasty. The fried potato sticks were a crunchy fun addition. The torta was a fun Cuban-ish twist on a Mexican torta, with really good black beans.The guava pastry was fresh and tasty with enough guava for my taste (which I've found isn't the case with most other place).In case the other hundreds of reviews didn't convince you, I highly recommend Porto's.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Cherie C.", "time": "4/14/2013"}, {"content": "Too much yummy stuff going on in this place at one time!
