Plus, \u00a0it's loud. \u00a0Good enough to hear your fellow diner, \u00a0but expect to yell, \u00a0\"what? \" every now and again. \u00a0The food was delicious. \u00a0I got the chorizo pie, chicken coquette, \u00a0and house salad (don't judge me, \u00a0my greens were very neglected this past week). In the chorizo pie I knew why people come here, \u00a0the crust was the perfect buttery flavor that you sometimes find in a really good quiche but with pie dough flakiness. \u00a0The chorizo was flavorful, \u00a0not too spicy, \u00a0I like my chorizo really saucy and this was an in between type. \u00a0So really good, \u00a0but not epic. \u00a0The chicken coquette tasted like chicken and gravy dinner from your elementary school days fried into a little ball of awesome. \u00a0Would be fun to pair it with a cranberry or gravy dipping sauce. Now, I would rate this place 4.5 stars if I could and the only reason being the salad and sub par napkins. \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0I'm stingy with my 5 star ratings. The salad. \u00a0So close to perfect. \u00a0But...but the black beans were a little overdone and had that grainy fibrous texture and the mango dressing a wee bit too sweet. \u00a0And the service? \u00a0Excellent. \u00a0Everyone welcomed me with a smile, patient even after dealing with cranky children, \u00a0laughed (or pretended to laugh) at my bad jokes, and when I told them this was my first time here? Were generous with recommendations. \u00a0So yet another review of Portos. I just had to add my two cents about the chicken coquette. \u00a0People should know it tastes like chicken and gravy dinner from your childhood!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Joannah L.", "time": "6/27/2015"}, {"content": "I can't give this place below 4 stars because I don't think it deserves anything lower. \u00a0The lines are long but it moves very quickly and efficiently. \u00a0The pastry display looks gorgeous and appetizing. I got the recommended cheese rolls, potato balls, the red velvet cupcake, and I also got a cherry turnover. The cheese rolls were great. Fluffy with a cheese filling. The potato balls come in either seafood or beef filling. I opted for both but I prefer the beef over seafood. \u00a0The red velvet cupcake got oversold! Both the cupcake and cherry turnover were good but nothing extraordinary. The best part is the price. This place is surprisingly very cheap and reasonably priced.

It's really simple, but the bread is just so soft.
