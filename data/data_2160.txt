As if guava isn't refreshing enough, blend it with ice, a little water and put it in that LARGE cup and you're set. Only other place I've had good guava juice was in Hawaii... that pink stuff by Kern's? No competition! Porto's is a slice of heaven.

The sandwich was pretty average- good but nothing that really stood out. The bread seemed very fresh. \u00a0The fruit tart was pretty big for a tart! It was a little hard but the fruit was delish.
