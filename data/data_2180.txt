Oh wait that's Cesar R's line! Let me clarify, Porto's potato balls are orgasmic!!! Please open one in Orange County!!! Preferable right next to my house! On 2nd thought, maybe that's not a good idea, I'd just turn into a fat pig and eat all day. Seriously amazing sandwiches, baked goods! Empanadas are the bomb! Ordered 5 sammies and not a single one was less than exceptional. Service was superb, I called 4 times to change my order and they were so patient with me. Prices are very reasonable.

You pull up into a layered lot so parking is never an issue. The building is a large modern beautiful building, and once you step inside the aroma of wonderful baked goodness quickly fills your nose. Their is always a line since this place is so popular , but the staff is amazing and quick to work through the line.The beloved cheese rolls are something i favor, as well as anyone who i know has visited portos. A beautifully glazed sweet flaky delicate browned pastry with an amazing cream cheese filing, a tasty treat i keep in my freezer ($0.70).The potato balls ($0.90) is \u00a0a mashed potato filled with seasoned ground beef, fried to golden brown. These are savory delectable treats, that i really enjoy.This place also offers sandwiches ,coffee, and tea. They have a huge selection of pastries and baked goods available to choose from. They cater, and also offer some selection in bulk and served cold for you to take and bake at home for your special occasion. This Should definitely be a spot you add to your itinerary when your in the area. This place speaks for itself, a solid 4 stars. A word of advice, everything is baked fresh daily in certain amounts, so if your coming in for something specific ( like the cheese rolls), it would be wise to plan the trip here early because they will run out.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Leah Marie T.", "time": "4/12/2014"}, {"content": "How is it possible that a bakery can be this busy, delicious and affordable?! Whatever it is, Porto's got it all. Tried it for the first time this week after hearing all the buzz for months now and I must say, all the rumors are true.

I've only tried their cheese rolls and a cake before. Both were delicious, but now that I've been, I feel like I'm 100% a fan of this place.The wait wasn't too long. Their system is pretty efficient. Cafe line on the left, bakery line on the right. Cake only line on the far right. They have a lot of workers so the line goes quick, too.We ordered the ever-so-famous potato balls and the cheese rolls as well as a couple smoothies. The potato balls, especially RIGHT when we got them, were SO FREAKING GOOD. The meat and veggies inside are so flavorful, covered in smooth potato, which I probably would've eaten by myself, battered and deep fried to perfection. I have to admit, I had a whopping THREE of them (trust me, it's like 1,320 calories for three of them) but I couldn't care less while I was eating them. The cheese rolls I've had before, but not like this. They were good before, when my friends brought me some. But when I got it fresh and warm, it was perfectly toasty and flaky. I love that the cheese isn't too cream cheese-y like most danishes and pastries. Now that I've had such good pastries, I am turned off by cheap pastries.I ordered the pina colada smoothie and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry banana. I can't say much about the latter, because I hate strawberry banana smoothies to start with (something about fruits with bananas that just doesn't work for me lol), but the pina colada was so good! I just needed some rum in there to make it PERFECT.The cake I've had before was so good too. The cream wasn't too sweet and the cake itself was really good. This was before I knew anything about Porto's, so I had no idea their pastries would be this good as well.It's tough because all three locations are so far away (Burbank, Glendale, and Downey), but I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Patricia L.", "time": "7/1/2013"}, {"content": "Best place ever to buy cakes and desserts.

They have a few salad options and breakfast omelets as well if that tickles your fancy. Most of the breakfast options where served with pork which I don't eat, so be aware of that. The people were nice and the service was fast, especially given the popular line. They were dog friendly outside and provided me with a little bowl for water when I asked. Personally, I don't have a desire to return but that because it's not my type of food.
