Every time we go we are lucky enough to find off street parking which means that we are always meant to go to Porto's each time we're there. There's also always a line that's at least 10 people long, but we do go on the weekends so that's to be expected. Whenever we go now I get a half or full dozen dulce de leche kisses: shortbread-style cookie exterior with a sweet and caramel-like creamy filling. Every calorie is worth it! These would definitely be part of my last meal! We also get the chicken croquettes and potato balls. They're savory and flavorful; really can't go wrong with either of these. Sometimes we spring for a pastry or a loaf of bread. Their baguettes are crusty and fluffy - so good just by itself or with Brie or butter and garlic!The ordering system is a little hectic so I recommend getting their menu card and writing down the amount of each item that you want next to each item. This is easier than trying to talk over the loud crowd and ensures that the clerk knows exactly what you want. Ever since we've started doing this, I don't get anxious when we get to the front of the line, and helps move everything faster for the next person!

Special shout out to George who made us feel at ease and told us to take our time looking around. (We came on Sunday 10/16 if there is more than one George). We ended up with three boxes full of baked goods for our flight home. Our boxes including Dulce De Leche kisses, Turnovers, Guava danishes, spinach danishes. We flew them back to the bay area when we had our first one. We knew this place was popular based on the reviews and just seeing it for ourselves but it wasn't until we tried the food we understood why. All the danishes had a crunch factor to them that made it taste so fresh. It was so flavorful even after a long day of travel. We loved every bite.

I didn't know they had one in Burbank until I saw how close it was to the Warner Bros. Studio so we came here while waiting for the Conan show to start. It's about two miles away and there's a parking lot for Porto's customers. Free parking for 1 hour. The layout and all is exactly the same as the one in Downey, except there's more outdoor seating in Downey. Things we got:-potato balls (of course!) -the extra cheesy jalapeno potato balls (we saw an ad for it so we got that too)-tuna melt with plantain chips-coffee-green tea smoothie with whipped cream-large raspberry mango macaron-pina colada mousseWe also got seats to sit there, usually we grab it to go but we had time to kill. The line to get a seat isn't too bad, we got our number and they seated us within 3 minutes. Our food came out in no time and we were eating. The potato balls were delicious, as usual. The extra cheesy one was pretty good but rather messy. The tuna melt my husband got was really good and I loved my green tea smoothie but I was getting full so I had to pace myself for dessert.Finally, I dug into the large raspberry mango macaron and I was disappointed that the macaron wasn't thin, flaky and hollow like a meringue should be for a macaron. It was dense and tastes like a brownie. I was disappointed. However, the mango mousse they had in between the macaron with raspberries were delicious. I was content just eating that part of the macaron. The pina colada mousse was delicious but we knew that, we get that every time we're at Porto's (hey, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it). Overall, I left there rather uncomfortably full but it was worth it. I'm craving the potato balls again just at the thought.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Cindy W.", "time": "8/13/2015"}, {"content": "Flew into Burbank yesterday and my first stop was Porto's Bakery Cafe. Walked in and walked by the pastry/dessert aisle (longest line) but ended up in the sandwich/food aisle I've been told to get a box of potato balls and the lines can be long. I was surprised that we only waited a few minutes in the sandwich/food line. We ordered the Cubano sandwich, chorizo & egg omelette sandwich, 2 potato balls, 1 spicy potato balls, soy latte and a large coffee. The total came to $20.00 which isn't bad at all. The potato balls were given to us while paying while the other items was brought to us. I took a bite of the spicy potato ball and it's amazing. I then took a bite of the potato ball and that was good too. The meat inside reminds me of taco meat but better. Shortly after finishing up the potato balls, our beverages arrived and the sandwiches. The chorizo & egg omelette sandwich was good but not great. My cousin had the Cubano sandwich and she said it was good. Her sandwich came with plantain chips. The soy latte was okay (rich bold flavor). After eating 1/2 of the sandwiches we were full and ended up taking both of our halves to go. \u00a0The staff were super friendly and quick. When I was done eating, I picked up our trash and walked towards the trash can to dispose of it. I was also thirsty so I asked a employee near the soda machine if I needed to go back to the front for a cup to get water - she said no and would get me one. She also took my trash from me to dispose of it. That's a very sweet gesture and unexpected. The two times that I went to use the restroom, the odd smell bothered me a little. The best way I can describe the smell is fresh pastries + urine. I know writing it out looks awful but that is what I experienced. I must say the restrooms were clean though. The exterior reminds me of buildings from Europe (not that I've been there) but from watching movies. P.S. Later in the day we switched the sandwich halves and I had a chance to try the Cubano sandwich was pleasantly satisfying. Not to mention the sandwich was packed with flavor. Overall, Porto's is the place to be no matter what time. You can beat the quality, service and price. I could eat Porto's any day and it's too bad there isn't one in PDX. Now that I've tried some savory goodness it's a must I return for some sweetness. If you haven't tried Porto's, please do.

This place is super popular with the valley locals, and it's a definite must if you're in town visiting. Don't be intimidated by the long lines! They go quickly, I promise. It's a bakery, but it's so much more than that! They have a HUGE variety of both savory and sweet baked goods, plus sandwiches, soups, salads, and drinks. Some popular items to try: potato balls, chicken croquettes, apple strudelMy personal favorites are their MUFFINS! Man oh man. They're so perfectly soft and moist inside, I've honestly never had a better muffin in my life. Specifically, my favs are the Apple Bran and Carrot & Apple. While most muffins can be really dense, these are so incredibly light that you don't feel guilty about scarfing down the whole thing. The best part about this place? The prices! Very affordable. Many of these baked goods are under $1/each, and the sandwiches are also very cheap. I also LOVE their sandwiches, which come with these delicious plantain chips (dine-in only). My regulars are the Feta Sandwich (sometimes comes with a liiiittle too much feta, though), the Turkey & Cheese Croissant, and the Caprese. Also, if you're there before 11, they have pretty tasty breakfast sandwiches as well - love the Cheese Omelette Sandwich! Can you tell I like cheese?The challenges: parking and seating. There's a small lot in the back, and street parking - that's about it. Seating is limited - it's not tiny inside or anything, but during the busy times, pretty much every table is taken up. If you're there with a group of people, it might be a good idea to send someone (who already knows what they want) to hold a table while the rest wait in line. There are also a few tables outside. Potentially confusing: the lines. When you walk in, there's a line on the left (for hot foods and baked goods/pastries), a line in the middle (for picking up drinks), a line on the right (for baked goods/pastries) and a line on the far right for picking up pre-ordered cakes. I BELIEVE there's an \"express\" line if you're only ordering hot food and/or a drink - I think it's near the drink pick-up area.Anyway, ENJOY!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Ashley C.", "time": "3/1/2016"}, {"content": "Everyone and their mom has been to Porto's or tried their delicious pastries so my review will be nothing special. \u00a0I came here on my last day of my trip to pick up some goodies before leaving SoCal. \u00a0This place is always packed and the line always seems to be out the door but what I like about Porto's is how fast they move customers.
