They have a wide selection of pastries, cakes, sandwiches and drinks, and they are all absolutely delicious! My personal favorites are the potato balls, and their cheese rolls. Other very good bites are their meat pies, guava rolls and dulce de leche kisses. The tiramisu cake is also very wonderful. My favorite sandwich is the media noche. Do you sense a pattern? Basically, you can't go wrong here, no matter what you order, you won't be disappointed! This location is on the corner of Hollywood Way and Magnolia, and parking can be terrible most of the time. There is someone there to try and direct traffic when it's super busy, but be prepared to circle the lot and fight for a spot! Once you've parked, there are actually three lines. One for sandwiches and pastries (and eating there), one for basically pastries and cakes, and one for whole cakes. They are all pretty long, except for the whole cake line. Thankfully, they have like 20 people working on either side, so the lines don't take too long. Plus, waiting in line gives you a few minutes to contemplate all the goodies you're about to devour! When it's super busy, they also have someone inside to help you find a table. One last tip, if you're ordering a sandwich, order it to eat there, they give you free plantain chips that are so good! They don't give then if you order you're sandwich to go. So go on, try everything on their menu, but pace yourself!

The best things that I tried were the potato balls and the pear pastry. The potato balls are balls of mashed potatoes combined with meat, breaded, and lightly fried. Sounds a little gross and heavy, but it's really good. Just don't get carried away for your heart's sake. I got to try a little of each of the pastries containing mango, pineapple, pear, and guava and they were all flaky and fresh on the outside with the sweetness of the fruit jam just right. I was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that they give samples! My friend was looking at the baked chicken item when the lady asked: \"Do you want to try it?\" We assumed she meant buying it and said \"sure, just 1.\" Right after that, she grabbed one, wrapped it in clear foil, and handed it to us. What a nice gesture. She even did it really happily, as if she worked at Disneyland or something. Props for the great customer service!The only downside to this place is the long wait that you need to endure due to the overwhelming popularity of this place. Whether you go to the deli side (which serves sandwiches and less of the pastries) or the bakery side (that serves pretty much everything) the wait during lunch time is generally 10-25 minutes, from what I experienced. I'd say that it's worth the wait and the fair prices. A 4.5 star average over 1500 reviews?

I made a list of places to try while here and Porto's was a must. A Sunday afternoon...I was prepared to wait in line and go head on with the crowd, but upon arriving, I, along with my cousin both found parking spaces in the private lot right away and there was no line at all inside. I didn't even have time to fathom what I wanted to get besides the Cheese Rolls, Potato Balls and Meat Pies. We were lucky as the line immediately grew behind us. It was a bit overwhelming as the guy behind the counter asked what we wanted to order. While the lady beside us was shouting out...\"Can I have 12 dozen cheese rolls!\" Whoa, really?! 12 dozen?!? I went with 1 dozen Cheese Rolls, 2 Guava and Chees Rolls, 5 potato Balls and 1 Meat Pie. I can always get back in line, I just wanted to try it. Also ordered a turkey and cheese croissant sandwich and a Lechon sandwich. Sandwiches were ok, nothing special, the plantain chips were a nice touch, the Potato Balls was too rich for me and the meat pies were...eh. The Cheese rolls were absolutely delicious! Pretty rich too, so I was glad I only ordered 1 dozen to bring back home.

A coworker told me about it, and I saw it after dropping someone off at Fry's. I knew I would have to pull in and get something!The parking lot in the back was large but packed! And when I went in, there were tons of people. It looks like there are two lines, one for sandwiches and cafe items, and one for the goodies from the bakery.I knew I would have to try the potato balls and meat pies, because those were suggested to me. I had a long time to look at all of the delicious pastries in the case as I was waiting, and I decided to pick up some goodies for my fiance and I for dessert. I got the opera bar and a napoleon for him, as well as a loaf of Cuban bread and a ciabatta roll. I ordered two turnovers, but they never made it into my box (but at least they didn't charge me for them, I got what I paid for, just not everything I ordered. I put this down as it was super busy and really loud; maybe he didn't hear me).I had to eat a potato ball before I could get home. SO DELICIOUS. it's kind of a twist on shepherd's pie: delicious meat and onion mixture, fluffy mashed potatoes...all in a convenient ball form. Yummy! I waited until I got home to eat the meat pie, and I think they have the same filling. Both were super tasty. I made sandwiches on the ciabatta, and it was chewy and perfect. We shared the opera bar that night, and it was rich and decadent. These desserts are big enough to share, though you probably won't want to! We had the napoleon the next day, but the puff pastry got soggy and it was hard to cut through. I'm sure it's better the same day, and I'll remember that for next time. Everything I purchased was super tasty, and it's reasonably priced! I'll have to talk myself into buying the potato balls by the dozen next time; I believe there's a discount. Each is sold for like $0.90. The pastries were about $3-4 each, but again, big enough to share (though hard to do cause they're so good!)I definitely recommend and will be returning, hopefully to try the sandwiches and new pastries (as well as those darn potato balls...)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Sarah E.", "time": "5/12/2014"}, {"content": "Get here around 11 am before the lunch crowds arrive!

When we did our wedding cake tasting with Portos, the cakes were dry and the frosting were overly sweet. The lines get insanely long but I guess they move them along pretty quickly.

At one point I heard a supervisor tell one of the girls to take a 10 minute break and when the girl expressed concern over the line the supervisor told her \"the line will still be there when you get back.\" I was in the store over an hour on a preorder pick up, which is frustrating because I could have waited in the line, ordered my food \u00a0and gotten out quicker.
