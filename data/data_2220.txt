The Cuban sandwich is my absolute favorite thing to get and the Papaya shake tastes amazing!!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Gabby R.", "time": "4/2/2015"}, {"content": "I always wanted to try \"Porto's\", see why this place is so appealing for so many people, see what's the \"catch\". Passing by their Burbank location, I saw lines outside many times and heard friends praising it.I even stopped in a few time to check it out, the pastries looked good, but the lines were way too long for me to wait around. Can't say I was a fan of the atmosphere of the place, loud, crowded, etc. \u00a0Another Saturday I got there right around 4 pm, closing time is 4:30 pm (didn't know) so I wasn't allowed in. That's too early to close a store/restaurant!But some friends brought over a cake from Porto's, the Tres Leches one and I loved it, it was so tasty and moist, exceeded my expectations. I decided to give Porto's another try. Parking is difficult, it's always hard to drive by, everyone wants a street spot near by.I was prepared to fight the crowds, so I \"studied\" the menu on line and wanted to try their praised hot appetizers, like the potato ball, empanadas type pastries and a Dulce de Leche cake. We even brought a small list with us, to be prepared to order fast. Are you kidding me?We got in a super long line, outside the store, looked around us to see nothing but chaos. Once I was able to see toward the windows with goodies, I realized that the trays were almost empty! Just a couple left over!So, we looked at the menu again (and we had time, boy, the line wasn't going anywhere, there were some other lines forming around us to increase the confusion, felt like I was in a railway station in Eastern Europe!) and had a plan B, decided on some sandwiches and the same Dulce de Leche cake. Finally, after half an hour of nothing but standing, we got at the register. We asked about the Dulce de Leche cake that we wanted to try, they didn't have it, and so we got the Tres Leches one. Disappointing! Then, we wanted to order the sandwiches and for the life of me I couldn't understand why the clerk was telling us to go and order somewhere else, another part of the store, another line. During this confusing conversation, some trays showed up full of potato balls type of appetizers so we switched the order, browsed the tray, figured out what they had, what we wanted and order the praised goodies. Finally, got the take out, and left the chaos behind. There's no way I would eat in that place, it's too crazy for me, not a relaxing place where you can enjoy a meal. OK prices.Once we got back home, I can't say I was impressed with the appetizers- tried the potatoes balls, ham and chicken croquettes, they were good, for sure not healthy, greasy, with lots of dough and cheese. Good, but not great or special enough for me to fight the crowds again at Porto's. So don't jump on me, but Porto's isn't my cup of tea.

I have a pretty bad sweet tooth, and Porto's caters directly to it. Their chocolate chip cookies are simply amazing. The first time I took a bite out of those bad boys was the most euphoric feeling ever! I come here a lot for lunch and primarily get their Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It's really good except for the fact that their chicken pieces are way too thick and I end up throwing half of it away.

It's probably the largest bakery I've ever seen with the longest lines for a bakery I've ever seen, but rest assured the employees are very efficient and the line goes by fast.My favorite thing to get here are the Dulce de Leche cookies. They are absolutely mouth-watering delicious and are just 50 cents each. The cheese rolls and guava cheese rolls are pretty damn good too. The sandwiches are just ok and I'd recommend passing on them. \u00a0There are dozens of other delicious-looking desserts that I have not had a chance to try yet.I honestly think the potato balls are overrated. Don't get me wrong, they are tasty but nothing to have a foodgasm over. They kind taste like a croquette with taco meat/cheese filling inside. They don't really keep that well either and will make your box greasy.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Stacey L.", "time": "2/8/2013"}, {"content": "Absolutely delicious!!!

Always my go to place for Thanksgiving goodies! But pre-order!!! TRUST ME on this one! The line is always out the door for non-preorders during holidays.

Doesn't matter if you go at 7AM or 7PM, there is always a crowd. I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered, food or desserts. This is definitely my go-to bakery for holiday goodies and whenever I'm brave enough to tackle the crowd during the weekend. And although there is several mini lots for parking, good luck!

I've been coming to Portos for a long time, when the Glendale location was the only one. Food:I've tried a lot of their items and choices. My favorite ones are: cheese rolls, coconut strudels, potato balls, dulce de leche kisses, midnight sandwich and chocolate tuxedo cake. Overall everything is delicious and it's hard to go wrong with your choices, just go by your tastebuds and what you thing you will like (everything is labeled). I've yet to tried their drinks but I'm hoping I can find an excuse to soon. I've brought countless boxes of these to parties and it's always a hit and gone quickly. The whole cakes are a little pricey and on the sweet side but still pretty delicious.Service: Quick service for the long (LONG) lines they get. The place is spit in two, sandwiches to the left and pastries to the right, once you enter the door you will see it. The pastry line is long but they have a lot of workers so the lines move quickly. Location:On the corner of Magnolia and Hollywood Way. Expect this area to usually be crowded and filled with traffic. What doesn't help Porto's is the tiny parking lot they have. I really wish they can somehow expand that parking lot because the amount of near accidents I've encountered is crazy.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Andy L.", "time": "2/5/2014"}, {"content": "How do I even dare start. It's Porto's.Their bestselling cheese rolls and guava cheese strudels never let me down.Oh shoot, I think my mouth is watering right now.Despite the crowds, the service is very efficient and quick. Even with deli, I don't remember it as my food came out slowly.And I LOVED what I ordered. I had the caprese baguette and fresh squeezed orange juice. Ever since then I've been in love with Caprese. Whether it's on a baguette, or it's bruschetta, or whatever, I just love the combination of mozzarella cheese and tomato slices. And the orange juice was so good I wished I could get it in a pack.I actually found the potato balls, another popular one, on a salty side. But that's okay, I got tons of other stuffs to have here.I wish I lived near Porto's.
