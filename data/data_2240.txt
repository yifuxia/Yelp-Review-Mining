I'd mention a few, but honestly, we like all of it. I like the non-dessert ones, too, like the empanadas and meat pies (under $1.00 each and really tasty). The smoothies and coffee drinks are excellent. The bad thing is the line--usually out the door, often down the street, but I've always been able to find parking in the back (off hours, maybe, but still a crowd). The place inside is large so you'll find seating and service is fast, in my experience. But be prepared for a line (there are several people always working the pastry counter--and another one or two taking orders from the rest of the menu which includes things like a Cubano sandwich and potato balls. Also salads and other kinds of sandwiches, although I like the ones with the Cuban style best). \u00a0There are two lines, but you can order sandwich and smoothies, etc. from the one in front of the pastry counter, too (they're side-by-side). The servers are so busy but everyone has always been calm and pleasant even in the most hectic part of the day. They're right about bringing boxes home with you. We do that whenever we go.

Their guava cheese rolls and reg cheese rolls are so good!! Crisp but soft outside with a yummy cream cheese inside. The potato balls though haha I've also tried their sandwiches and those are good and fairly priced [less than $5 for most of them]. The line also goes by fast so thats great. The service is okay.

Lets get started!FOOD: I usually go with the Feta sandwich, which is Feta cheese, fresh basil, vine ripened tomatoes, red onions, Italian dressing, on a French baguette. This sandwich taste fresh and crisp, and truly melts in your mouth. You could also go with the Chicken Torta, which is Marinated and grilled chicken breast, black bean spread, goat cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions, on a French round. This is another great choice you could take advantage of as this will fill you up and will not leave you hungry. You could wash these edible treats down with a fresh Mojito, which is (there is no alcohol)but light and refreshing with a touch of fresh mint!SERVICE: Service is great. You do run into long lines, but that's because its just that good, so you wait for some food goodness right?

The only drawback is that it's extremely busy but their sandwiches are good and many of the baked goods are, too. I just posted the Papa Preparanda sandwich which is simply two potato balls smashed inside Cubano bread, Swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Nothing fancy but so good. There's a ground meat mixture in the potato balls. I've had the tuna melt and the steak sandwich before and loved them also. Since I'm out of town, I always get a dozen potato balls, a dozen meat pies (also ground meat inside), and a dozen cheese rolls to take back to my family of boys. All three total less than $30 and so worth it. Their chocolate mousse is good and so is their Berry and cream cake. It's a bit hard to find seating when they're busy so I usually just get take out.

Also since we enjoyed them over a course of 1- 2 days ( we really had to hold ourselves back) they tasted delish even after the 2nd day. You must give this a try. It will change your world.
