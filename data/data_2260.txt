[{"content": "Line is long but worth the wait! They have two lines at this location and it moves fast. It was my first time actually going here since I had only tried Porto's infamous cheese rolls from traveling relatives. The parking lot was full on a Monday afternoon but people were coming and going so 3 spots opened up after entering the lot. They had a special of one dozen cheese rolls for $7.85, whereas each they're seventy cents. A dozen guava cheese rolls is $8.55. Of course I had to buy 3 dozen cheese rolls and 2 dozen guava cheese rolls to bring back home. The guava cheese rolls are amazing! I kept hearing about how delicious they are and now I know it's true. Porto's pastries are light and flaky without the gross taste of lard. The guava filling isn't heavy at all and tastes extra good when very hungry to get the full effect. The potato balls are bomb! Crispy fried/bread crumbed outside & soft potato inside filled with juicy ground meat (90 cents each). The meat pies are flaky and satisfying (not that I would know, the only 2 we bought were eaten and I didn't get a taste). Poor chicken empanadas were left in the box, almost untouched after reaching for the potato balls ...Go here. Like seriously. Go here if you're in SoCal!!

Porto's get 5 stars! \u00a0I purchased my King Cake there for Mardi Gras (in addition to another couple of main staples - potato balls and coconut macaroons).I posted a question on Yelp asking for a recommendation for where I could buy a King Cake and one of the answers I received was Porto's. \u00a0I would have never expected Porto's to offer these, but I was being lazy about driving to Los Angeles to the one place I know carries them (even though I could have gotten pralines if I would have gone there).To my amazement.... this was as good (if not better) than the other place. \u00a0The cost was only $16 and it was freshly made! \u00a0It was still warm when I brought it home. \u00a0It was all I could do to wait until this evening to start eating it, but it's a good thing I waited.... or it would have been the only thing I ate all day.Porto's King Cakes are amazingly deliciious - buttery brioche dough with a sweet cream cheese filling and covered with a glaze and Mardi Gras colored sugar.I've eaten so much of it that I had to unbutton my pants! So where's the Mardi Gras party with dancing? \u00a0I need to work off this cake so I can eat some more. \u00a0Yum!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lillian M.", "time": "2/12/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "Every time I fly into Burbank to visit my college Roomie, it is tradition that we stop at Porto's to and from the airport.Every single thing I have ordered from Porto's is beyond amazing.

I work a mile away, and I'm leaving in a few days for good so my co-workers thought it was a must to go to Portos. A 5 minute drive, opening parking, and bamn I am through the doors. My initial reaction doesn't do this place justice. \"Holy shi......\" This place is HUGE. Not like Omg this place can fit like 30 people, no this place is big enough to be a friggin supermarket. WHAT KIND OF BAKERY IS THIS? People everywhere!The line went quick and before I knew it I had to order. There were so many things I was told to try that I was overwhelmed. \"Its my first time\" I muttered to the employee who rushed a cheese roll for me to try. Before I knew it she was dictating my entire order. Potato balls, cream cheese danish, chicken croquette, chicken fajita sandwich. I thought I ordered a ton of food, and I did, but the bill caught me off-guard. $11? THAT'S IT? Walk down the clean isles to the seating area, put my order number down and before I knew it my food was right there.Best part? Everything tasted SO AMAZING. Seriously. I just ate through everything. Screw every repercussion of not surviving the rest of the work day due to food coma. This was worth it. Honestly, I regret coming here. Maybe ignorance is a bliss and I shouldn't have stepped in because I'm kicking myself for not taking the time to come out earlier.

I was wondering what all the hype was about and let me tell you. THE HYPE IS REAL!

I'm in love), and half a dozen chicken croquettes (so tasty). When I first walked in, the amount of people was so overwhelming I wanted to hide in a corner. Surprisingly, the lines went pretty fast. When you order you need to remember who the person helping you is and then you have to follow that person wherever they go. It seemed a bit too chaotic for my first time, but after I bit into a cheese roll, it was worth it.

When I walked into Portos the other day, it was very busy and I had no idea of the type of cake I wanted for our company party.
