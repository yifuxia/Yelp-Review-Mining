Ppl run in and grab freshly made bagel bags and breads!! insane....but well worth it.REVIEW for both Glendale and Burbank - This Cuban bakery and cafe can never go wrong. EVERTHING is bomb.I've ordered bday cakes here, they have you sample them upstairs when you wanna order one! Orange juice is $3 but its FRESHLY made, you see those oranges get sliced and juiced right before your eyes.FOODBreakfast croissants, ham and cheese to eggs and veggies are exquisite and cheap! quality for good $$They only have pork tamales, Cuban love pork!! So if you can eat this, def. a different taste from ordinary mexican tamales of course, very good!TThe popular cuban sandwich is great, lots of beef and pork! Yet very light and served on a french rollGrilled Chicken Fajita sandwich has a robust an tropical flavor along with roasted veggies inside the bun!! Veggie sandwich comes with egg plant, LOVE IT.Turkey croissant sandwich is out of this world, nto your ordinary take on a Turkey sandwich, you have to try it for yourself. All sandwiched served with banana chips.Green salad is perfect for sharing and for those veggie peeps!Coffee is deliciously brewed fresh!BAKED GOODS and SIDES -Where do I even start? Please try the Potato balls (if you can, contains beef) they are outta this world, freaking good and inexpensive. If youa re a veggie, try the plantains \"rellenitos\" or the Cheese balls or Guava sides!Rum cake is one of their specialties, oh and you can so tell...well your taste buds can! ;-)Apple Muffin, Blueberry muffins, apple and pumpkin pies, oatmeal and chocalate chip cookies, to the spinach sandwich and meat pies... they are all baked and made fresh daily and cooked to perfection.

Infact I generally avoid this place at all costs. However I went the other day to pick up a few things for my friends birthday, and I was very happy with my experience. Let me start by saying, there is no good time to go to Porto's. The parking can be a nightmare, and the lines resemble that of Disneyland. However, the food is delicious, and the prices are great. For $20 I brought back three boxes of delicious treats, including potato balls for our party. My experience here is that the service is so so. I realize that they are busy, and I hate people who have stood in line for 20 minutes and still don't know what they want, but I equally hate feeling rushed. On this particular visit I had a friend with dietary restrictions, and I needed to ask what was in certain pastries. Luckily, the person helping me was patient, but this isn't always the case.I don't crave Porto's, but I certainly won't turn it down... especially if someone else is the one standing in line :)", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Victoria R.", "time": "3/24/2014"}, {"content": "It's been almost a month since I've been to Porto's Bakery and I still dream about the place.

To describe Portos in a few words would be barbaric and not do it any justice. I've had the luxury of enjoying the potato balls, chorizo and meat pies. The chorizo and meat pie are out of this world and immediately require that you have another. The potato balls are indescribable, but if I had to say something, imagine taking a bite of out heaven and having seconds. That's what it is like. The pork samich is something extraordinary which having one basically seems like an insult, have one there and take 2 more home for dinner and lunch the next day.

Much to my surprise its a ball of potato filled with what seems like chili and ground beef. \u00a0It is good, but not my favorite. \u00a0Get some tapatio with this.Meat pie- Same filling as the potato ball but with a flaky exterior. \u00a0I liked the potato ball better.Cheese roll- I had to be the MOST skeptical about this one because as much as I love cheese I don't like anything too cheesy. \u00a0The name cheese roll immediately turned me off but unexpectedly, this ended up being my FAVORITE ONE. \u00a0It was sooo good! \u00a0It didn't have that \"cheesy\" flavor at all. \u00a0It was flaky, light and crisp with a soft filling. \u00a0Yum yum so heavenly.Guava cheese roll- This one was not to my liking.. \u00a0I'll stick to the original cheese roll.Dulce de leche coffee- Had to get my caffeine fix. \u00a0Tastes just like a caramel macchiato. \u00a0Was good but had wayyy too much caramel in my opinion. \u00a0Next time I would order with light on the caramel.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Lilly C.", "time": "2/22/2013"}, {"content": "Damn do believe the hype.

People absolutely love this place. It's amazing. When you dine in and order a sandwich I was looking at everyone's plates and saw that they give you banana chips instead of regular chips.

The pastries are always fresh, the cakes are moist, the cheesecakes are delicious and so fourth.The turkey croissant sandwich with the banana chips are my choice of lunch here with a tasty horchata smoothie. They really try their best to be as organized as possible and they really try to keep the lines moving. I really wish they had more cashiers and more space. It's always so uncomfortable trying to pay with a million people piled up blocking your way when you're just trying to go.Parking sucks so good luck and just park on the street!Prices are okay. Your mouth will be happy though so don't be a negative nancy.Overall, I love this place and all the wonderful things it has to offer.

Of the bakery items, we got potato balls (1 dozen), chicken croquettes (half dozen), ham croquettes (half dozen), chicken empanada (four pieces), and chorizo pie (four pieces). Pastry items (8 pieces) included assorted varieties.The quality and taste of the items was very good and delicious! When we received the bakery items, all were warm and fluffy, and needless to say very fresh. The potato balls and ham croquettes were consumed in a very short time. By the next day everything was consumed.Our neighbor told us that she had to wait over 45 minutes for the items. Between her family and ours, over $130 was spent at Porto's. She said that parking was not a problem with plenty of space.Based solely on the quality of food, I am upgrading my review of Porto's.
