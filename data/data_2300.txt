But who's complaining. The lines weren't even that long the last two times I went. If you visit this place, you got to get the guava cheese, meat pies, and potato balls. Must haves! They run out of some popular items though, chicken empanadas/tamales... so I guess go early (even though we were there before noon). Also, try out those ducle de leche kisses. It's like a soft sugar cookie with a gooey dulce de leche interior.

She even let me try a potato ball for free! I then ordered the omelette platter and three potato balls. The omlette was done perfectly, the cheese melted in the middle.

I don't know if they're crazy or they're just reasonable everyone else in LA is crazy, but everything from the sandwiches to the desserts at this place are half of what you'd expect to pay at any other restaurant. A giant, fresh-baked banana muffin is $1.15. Nuts. Like I said, very good food--but I haven't had anything here that'll just blow you away. I recommend any of their fried balls--mashed potatos, croquettes, etc. The muffins are fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of the chocolate they use--it's a little bitter for my taste--but you can't go wrong with a banana muffin or a croissant or a breakfast sandwich with a fruit cup. Also, don't let the long lines fool you--it all moves very quickly. You only get really jammed up if you're waiting for coffee.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Hugh S.", "time": "4/9/2014"}]
