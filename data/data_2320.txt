I usually pick up some essentials like the cheese rolls and guava pastries but from time-to-time I'll pick up something new and tasty looking. Today was no exception. I went ahead and chose their mango mouse, flourless chocolate cake and eclairs. While these were by default some great options, their pastries have fallen hard from what it once was not too long ago. Their large cakes are now uneven. Their Opera cakes are strangely flat and thin while their cake slices seemed to have been made in a rush. This would bring down their rating to 4 as taste definitely trumps presentation but not today. Their cheese rolls were misleading in that most of the cheese was outside the pastry while the inside was fairly hollow. Their flourless cake was dry and cakey almost like an overcooked brownie while their mango mouse filling was too sour to compliment the pastry. I suggest Porto's to step up their game and get some quality control on their products before people start paying attention and the hype dies down. To end on a high-note almost every person who has helped me with my order has been nothing but polite. But when I come in to order pastries to-go, customer service will only go a long way (2 stars out of 5).", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Chane M.", "time": "5/10/2015"}, {"content": "Not much to say.

We have tried some of the others like the apple turnover, mango turnover, and some other goodies. They were good but cheese rolls are a definite winner. Today we decided to try the cupcakes. One chocolate and one red velvet. They were both really good, moist, not to dry. I prefer chocolate so the cake and the cream were amazing. The red velvet is good too but for me personally i am just not a huge fan of cream cheese. My boyfriend really enjoyed the red velvet.Also if you get the chance to have a nice sandwich I highly recommend the Cuban sandwich.

Once you found an empty space, it feels you won the jackpot at least that's how I felt ;)There is a long line but the wait isn't too long as it goes by really fast. Quick and prompt service. Their potato balls is a must every time I go there. Although I do now prefer their chicken instead. I've also noticed that also got the seafood version of the potato ball a limited time.

And since I've already gleefully Yelped the Glendale location with a 5 star review (see my review here: yelp.com/user_details_re\u2026), it's fitting that I give Burbank the 5 stars it deserves as well.I've been to both the Burbank + Glendale locations recently, + from what I can tell, the locations are comparable in terms of quality/consistency of the yummy food, efficient service at the counter, same decor/atmosphere, both in suburban downtown neighborhoods, decent amount of seating except when super packed... + yes, the lines can be just as infamously long at the Burbank location at lunch time during the week + at almost all hours on weekends, too. The only primary difference would probably be that the Burbank location does look a bit nicer + has a more spacious set-up with separate 2 lines for counter service rather than 1.Anyways... back to the \u00a0CHEESE ROLLS! These babies are what draw me back time + time again. The sweet cream cheesy-ness oozing out of the sides the flaky pastry, mmm. It's bliss at first bite! And somehow I can never manage to leave without grabbing a few or a whole zillion to-go in their cute little boxes with me. yelp.com/biz_photos/fYrn\u2026Most of the time I'll either grab other pastries to accompany my staple item such as Potato Balls, Guava Rolls, the Cheese + Guava Roll, a Chocolate Croissant, a Chocolate Chip Muffin... etc, yelp.com/biz_photos/fYrn\u2026 all of which range in price from about $0.70-$1.50 each. SO CHEAP! Porto's policy is to box the hot + room temperature items separately, but you can easily ask for extra boxes so that you can rearrange the goodies in boxes accordingly such as if you're buying extras to share at work or for friends. Or other times I'll grab a sandwich like the Hot Pastrami, Pan con Lechon yelp.com/biz_photos/fYrn\u2026, Cubano, or the Ham + Cheese Omelette Croissant yelp.com/biz_photos/fYrn\u2026. The Pastrami is by far my favorite, though, since I'm just a pastrami fan like that. The sandwiches are all big enough that I eat 1/2 there + then take the other 1/2 home for later. The signage says that most sandwiches aren't available until after 10am, but I've had no problem ordering them as early as around 8am before. And all being priced at or under $5, these are such a steal of a deal as well. Ordering in gets you free plantain chips sprinkled on the plate with your sandwich, but no chips when ordering to-go, booooo. I admit that still have yet to try Porto's cakes + coffee from either location, but my Cheese Roll addiction + contentment with everything else about Porto's are satisfying enough to be worthy of 5 stars.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Janelle Q.", "time": "11/16/2010"}, {"content": "I wrote this Letter to their corporate office on Christmas Eve. \u00a0It was addressed to Bobby, however no one has responded noe acknowledged my email of concern: Hello,I am writing to complain about a bad experience I just had here at your Burbank Location. \u00a0I am from Orange County and had to travel a long way to get to your location.
