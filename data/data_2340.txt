Don't be scared of a long line it moves really quickly. I've been there 3 times and we tried to try different pastries. So here is what I'd never give up:* Potato ball - mmm;* Cheese roll - I'm almost crying when finishing it* Apple strudel - super puffy pastry with apples is just melting in a mouth * Chocolate chip cookie - that's my husband favorite and i understand him* Tres leches cake (individual) - just try it once, moist cake sitting in a splash of condensed milk, its a heaven.Veeeeeeery good:* Ham croquette* Small meat pie* Cherry turnover* Chocolate croissantWe tried but these are not my favorite:* Spinach croissant* Dulce kisses* SandwichesWhoever is on the road to Porto's now, I'm jealous guys!

They have such an extensive menu and so many sweets (I have a sweet tooth so it's a little overwhelming!). My personal favorites are the potato balls with meat and the dulce de leche kiss. Their orange juice is very fresh as well. It's usually crowded and parking in their back lot is kind of annoying but it's totally worth it for their food. Check out their huge menu online on their website with pictures - it will help you narrow down your search otherwise when you get there you could have a hard time deciding and like I said it's usually very crowded.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "manoela w.", "time": "4/6/2015"}, {"content": "Coconut macaroons, dulce de leche kiss and ofcourse guayaba smoothie.

Just keep your head out of your phone and pay attention to line gaps haha. No, you're not in Europe and if you expect that caliber of pastries you will be disappointed. \u00a0BUT if you like consistent Cuban savory and sweet goods then Porto's is the place! I always enjoy a meat pie, guava cheese strudel, \u00a0chocolate chip muffin, and their Italian sub is BOMB. And when they are not crazy busy the quality of their cafe con leche is pretty good. My only gripe is seeing their employees on their cell phones...it's just unprofessional. Also, I noticed while waiting for my drinks that employees on break would order drinks too which is totally fine (they work hard) HOWEVER, during peak times they shouldn't be allowed to wait for their drinks and talk and distract their co-workers who are making them...just sayin'.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Aimee K.", "time": "4/6/2015"}, {"content": "I know we all love Porto's and how good their cafe/bakery is.

I've heard so many people rave about this Cuban bakery in the city of Burbank. I'm so glad my friend mentioned let's go!! Luckily we were only 2 miles away. As you walk inside there are so many delectable pastries, sandwiches, and meals to choose from. What's highly recommended up in this joint? Their Potato balls, stuffed with Mashed potato filled with seasoned ground beef, fried to golden brown. YES it's Delicioso!!! Each potato ball is 90.cents which is not bad, worth every bite! For my main meal I ordered the Cubano sandwich. This sandwich contains slices of slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, butter, and mustard and mayonnaise mix on Cuban bread. This sandwich is also served with plantain chips for only $4.85 OOOHHH yes I felt like a kid in a candy store as I gobbled my sammich down lmao! For desserts my favorite were Puff pastry filled with guava and cream cheese. Got me sprung!!! hahaa along with their Triple chocolate mousse. A layer of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate mousse on a chocolate tuile cookie and finished with chocolate ganache.If your ever in SoCal. please make a stop!!!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Kathy V.", "time": "11/1/2010"}, {"content": "Apple owes Porto's Bakery a ton of money. In 2013, Apple made $10B in sales on the app store, and i'm sure a significant amount of that money was made in this very store. The first thing that greets you when you enter this bakery isn't the awesome smell coming from the bakery in the back, or the bright, sunny eating space where people lounge around and chat. It's the double giant lines (one for cakes, and one for umm... not cakes) that snake through the entire lobby and sometimes out the door. And while these people wait for their cheese roll and potato ball fix, what do they do? Hit up the app store for more Clash of Clans and Angry Bird goodness. Food wise, everyone gets the cheese rolls and potato balls. Guava cheese rolls get an honorable second mention. The sandwiches are massively underrated. Do yourself a favor.

From your sweet treats to your savory sandwiches and delicious blended coffee drinks on a hot Burbank day; you can't go wrong when you come here. This large location in Burbank with its huge selection of everything yummy has been a favorite of mine since I moved to the valley from the westside some four years ago. \u00a0A good friend introduced me to this place and instantly I was hooked! Oh those potato balls! And their guava cheese and cheese roll are among my favorite. The steak torta sandwich is one of my absolute favorite sandwiches and I also love their breakfast egg sandwich with the guacamole. Another favorite is their tuna sandwich on a croissant which if you don't get to go comes with those yummy plantain chips. (This is true about all sandwiches btw). Every visit is an opportunity to try something new and I have yet to be disappointed. Don't let the long line of hungry fans of this place discourage you; the many helpful servers keep things moving pretty fast. It can however be a pain to find a parking spot during their peek hours (i.e. lunch) in their lot but usually there's street parking and it's not too bad.
