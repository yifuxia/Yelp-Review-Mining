The food is amazing, prices are good, and plenty of options for everyone. Some of my favorite things are the potato balls, meat pies, the sandwiches, and all sweets. But to be honest, everything that I've ever had here is very very very good. You just can't go wrong.

They move pretty quickly thanks to the fantastic staff members waiting to take your order at the register. The food is delicious. I believe this place is my first Cuban food experience, and I'm excited to try more! The sandwiches are fantastic and are served with a side of plantain chips - yum!The iced coffee and lattes are also great.Seating can be a little tricky sometimes, but nothing too crazy. Probably not the best spot to stop in with a laptop, but definitely a great breakfast or lunch spot.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Kaity J.", "time": "10/7/2012"}, {"content": "The cheese rolls here are to die forrrrrr!!!

I just knew that whenever people paid this place a visit, they would buy multiple boxes worth of their pastries. Everyone would rave about the potato balls, cheese rolls and guava cheese strudels. I was surprised how cheap it was. I ordered a dozen potato balls, 6 cheese rolls and 6 guava cheese strudels. I was so full from our food adventure previous to coming to porto's so I didn't really taste anything till we got back to Sacramento. I was so shocked to find out that the potato balls tastes just like Popeye's mash potatoes. It was delicious!!! I thought the cheese roll would be savory but it was sweet and flaky. I thought the guava cheese strudel would be super sweet but the amount of sweetness was PERFECT! I loved the flaky, buttery crust on the strudel. I wish I would've tried it when it was warm. By the time I got home, it was cold and somewhat soggy but still yummy. At least now I know to order a lot more next time and eat it right away!
