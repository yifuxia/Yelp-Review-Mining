Coworkers and friends have been bringing me Porto's for years, but I finally made the journey over the hill into the valley for myself just a few days ago. Traffic from LA proper at 6 AM was totally manageable, and when I arrived just around opening time there was plenty of parking and only about 10 people ahead of me in line. I, of course, got the classics - potato balls (reheat in the toaster oven by slicing open and heating at 400 degrees for several minutes) and guava cheese strudels. I also got the chicken croquettes (delicious) and the spinach cheese croissant (flaky crust, yummy filling with good balance of spinach and cheese). Everything is so affordable that you can buy as many delicious pastries as you want without breaking the bank. Sweets (chocolates, cakes) are a little pricier so you may not want to go as crazy buying those. Besides, those flaky pastry crusts are where it's at. There are no pictures of anything I bought because, well, it's in my belly. The long line gives you plenty of time to eye the goodies and decide what you want. Adrian was an excellent .. not a waiter, not a cashier, but whatever his job title is, he was very good and friendly.

Never did I imagine Porto's to be so huge and such a chaotic mess on a late Saturday afternoon. Luckily we found parking easily even though it was extremely packed.There were at least 100 customers in here, 2 separate lines, and a separate line for cake order/pick up. A handful of tables, and then a larger dining area off to the side. Waited a good 30 minutes or so and yelled my order of numerous potato balls, cheese rolls, cheese potato balls, empanadas, and apple turnovers (for me and many others that had requested back home). Don't know how the workers stay sane here with the steady traffic and constant orders. I also ordered a Cubano to eat on the drive home, which I picked up quickly around the corner. $50 easily spent.The potato balls were better than I remembered, cheese rolls absolutely divine as I remember, and the cheese potato ball was a yummy treat. The cubano was just okay, nothing special, although probably better eating it as soon as it's ready instead of hours later.

Our favorites are the cheese rolls, guava cheese rolls, and dulce de leche kisses. It's difficult to walk out of Porto's without a box (boxes?) of goodies.

Portos is seriously THE BEST. I am a bit obsessed.....I got to this location and was a bit confused. There were two lines, one to the left (moves faster) and one to the right. I think the one to the left is the one where you order drinks. Apparently you can get whatever you want on both sides. But it is the one on the right that you can see all the pastries in the display rather a limited amount on the left. So first timers, use the right! The line moves pretty fast so don't worry too much about that. Also the workers are REALLLYY nice, definitely something I appreciate when I go out and get food.I seriously wanted EVERYTHING. But I thought I should limit myself. Chicken Croquette: It was very rich in flavor. Since potato it was definitely heavy. I really liked it because it was not over bearing and not too hot or cold. Cheese and Pepper potato ball: One of my favorite! The cheese was melted, tasted like queso, which is my personal favorite so maybe that is why i liked it. It also isn't spicy really.Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: Can't say too much about it because its the second time i've ever had it but it is definitely my favorite of the two. It isn't too overdone thus nice and light but still pretty sweet. The sugar on top was also tasty. Cheese Roll: Ehh I liked it. It was nice and light. The thing is, I think it was a bit over hyped. Not my favorite of everything I got today. Spinach and Feta croissant: The croissant was nice and fluffy and buttery (?). It tasted REALLY good. The feta and spinach also complemented each other well. I wish it was more of a spinach and feta croissant sandwich rather than just having it in the middle.

They currently don't have it on the menu. Maybe they do, and my blurry vision can't seem to locate it! But every time I stumble upon Porto's I ALWAYS get it.

The food is great, the service is great and it is always worth the trip!The sandwiches are cheap ($5.45 for a cubano) and super delicious. My favorite pastry is the guava cheese tart, but anything you order will be top notch. And you have to order a potato ball and eat it while it's hot! They also make beautifully decorated wedding cakes that are very tasty. You can at up an appointment to do a tasting and tell them exactly what your looking for.This particular Porto's is large and the line is always long but it moves quick. They have a decent amount of seating and clean restrooms.
