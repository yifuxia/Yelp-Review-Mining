The Cuban pastries, deli sandwiches and drinks were all delicious! I went Yelper crazy and bought a meal for like 10 to try out everything. I know I know, thats crazy, but who knows when I was going to come back? They had a ginormous \"to go\" side of pastries. I mean, my mouth was savorying by all the colors and assortment of eclairs, puddings, croissants, cookies, etc... I mean, some of the pastries and desserts there, looked so pretty. I can now see why people walk in and out like clock work, with yellow Porto boxes in hand or more like dollied out. I compare this place to a mid to high end, Panera Bread slash Corner Bakery slash Pastry shop, Cuban Style pastries of course. For the romantic Yelpers, I highly suggest, if you live by or visiting a Porto's Bakery, create a fun array of desserts from Porto's and surprise your loved one...

It is kind of a restaurant, only you order your food at the counter and then it is served to you. \u00a0The Burbank location is a large setting, with a display case of sweet treats that consumes half of the restaurant. \u00a0Literally when you order, it is impossible NOT to get a dessert. \u00a0This time, I ordered the Ropa Vieja sandwich, a chicken croquette, and a guava pastry. \u00a0All of their sandwiches comes with a handful of salty-delicious-banana chips. \u00a0My sandwich was authentic and delicious.
