That's why you should driver over to Burbank location! There's still a line but it's way faster than Glendale one. I believe my wait time was less than 5 minutes.+Cheese rolls, guava cheese, potato balls, chicken croquette, and cubano sandwiches are my favorites!+All the danishes and sweets here aren't overly sweet, similar to Asian desserts & pastries. For example, cheese rolls uses sweetened cream cheese filling but it's not too rich & it has perfect amount of sweetness.

I mean seriously, wow. I cannot stress the importance of service with a smile, especially when I've stood in line waiting for the length of time that I did. The guy that waited on us had such an attitude, like he had just woken up and I had such nerve to actually bother him with a food order. If you're gonna act like an ass and ruin my morning, maybe it's in the managements best interest to put him in the kitchen, or have him clean toilets. Keep him out of sight and out of mind of paying customers. So, the baked goods were tasty,but they were out of 2 items I wanted. No apologies, no recommendations to get in their place. He just sort of stared blankly at me waiting for me to pay. After all was said and done he hands me all of my food in about 3 paper bags. Because I had ordered for more than myself, I really would've preferred a box...which I asked for. 45cents for a box...like I'm going to use it as a souvenir. The bags can't be stacked, the plastic containers keep the heat and moisture in making the items soggy and blech. But my preferred method of storage is going to cost extra. Overall, a bad experience that will probably take a long time to forget.

Fortunately I don't live in the neighborhood, otherwise I can't control my voracious appetite when I see anything (pastry boxes, paper bags, plastic bags, drinks...etc) related to Portos.4 Star - the only complain is limited parking and long lines in the store. If you stop by during the busy hours, there are always huge lines on both sides. Also, they have a strange phone order policy. I called them earlier this week to order cupcakes for a birthday party - I wanted to order 15 of each flavor - chocolate, red velvet and vanilla. The lady over the phone couldn't take my order, per their store policy they can take orders only for a dozen over the phone.

(Hint:Time for a location in the Bay Area). The cheese bread is very delicious! They are flaky, light and not too sweet. The guava and cheese strudel was a perfect mix of sweet and savory. I loved the fried potato balls with meat filling!! It had the filling you would see in an empanada but surrounded by potato. The strawberry croissants and chocolate chip cookies were also great! The lady who boxed our order was super friendly. She always asked if we wanted a sample of anything. Porto's is definitely not stingy, as they gave us full samples. With the intention of just getting cheese bread, we left with three big boxes of baked yuminess! Prices are reasonable.

It's a little salty but still good. Nothing really to rave about. They also come with banana / plantain chips if you eat in... but they have boxes of them ready to go. I asked for one and they said you can only get it if you'r eating in. My dumbass just said ok and left, but you should just say you're eating in and get some -_____- They're better than the sandwiches.It's like always busy at lunch time, so come early or come later, but not like.. at lunch.
