I went to pick up my daughter in Hollywood and told her I was in a major carb mood. I wanted something sweet. She suggested Porto's in Burbank, \u00a0for their quality and price. I saw something about them once on one of those food channels. I think it was how to spend 24 dollars to eat in 24 hours. When we got to this bakery, I had to wipe the drool off my face. Waiting in line, I made a mental note of everything I wanted to try. That was pretty much everything. I was prepared to spend a fortune. We got back to the table, and proceeded to taste everything that I purchased. Pure sugar heaven!!! Unfortunately my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but the good news, I got to take it all home and eat it over the next couple of days! I can't wait to go back and try one of their sandwiches.

They were a bit smaller than usual, but they tasted amazing. My brother thought there was too much almond paste, but I begged to differ!Your banana-nut muffin was pillow-soft, as well. I was a bit disappointed to see that you guys ran out of hot ham and cheese croissants - again. But you know what made up for that? Your excellence in customer service.Remember that woozy feeling? Yeah, well, I ended up leaving my phone at the cash register; I didn't realize until an hour later. I was too tired to freak out so I just made my way back there. I explained to their awesome floor manager, whose name escapes me (he's there usually and is a great person!), that I had an ugly iPhone with a boost case on it. They seemed to agree and quickly brandished my phone from behind the counter. The floor manager assured me that everything was cool and that it was found immediately.

If you've ever tried to park here during the weekday lunch rush, you know how painful it can be to find a spot here. And after all that stress of trying to park the car, you come inside to a long line as well. But once your food arrives (with amazing efficiency) and you bite into that Cuban sandwich, potato ball, guava cream cheese strudel, or whatever it is you ordered, you know that the wait was well worth it! I come to Porto's on every trip to LA, it's been a fave since I used to live here. There are so many things I like, it's always hard to decide what I should get and so I often end up over-ordering and leaving really full. This is also a great place to get cakes for any occasion.

Not only are they willing to give you a free sample, but the employees have the patience and concentration to memorize your order!I ordered a tuna melt and I found it to be a pleasant meal! The bread was toasted to perfection and the tuna was tasty. I also ordered a blended coffee drink. My beverage was nice and sweetly blended, surely bringing a smile to my face!

I can finally say that I've arrived what many of my friends are raving about... as expected the lines were long (one line for the bakery section and one line for the sandwich section).
