WHAT? \u00a0I said I probably have a total of 12 items, but not of EACH. \u00a0I explained that I'd been on hold already and it would still take me 20 minutes to get there, then stand in line, etc. but no, not even as a courtesy would she take the order. \u00a0Her English wasn't that good - perhaps she was making a mistake? \u00a0Or she didn't understand the policy (which seemed a bit crazy). \u00a0Regardless, I said (and then also commented to a manager when I was in there) - that if they have a policy like that, then they should have an out-going message while you're on hold so you don't waste your time. \u00a0The manager wasn't sure of the policy either as he said the call center wasn't his department. He thought it was a minimum $20 total bill amount, not a minimum of 12 of each item. \u00a0 I get that they're busy, but a message saying what the requirements are to order by phone for pick up would have helped a whole lot. \u00a0It took me over an hour all together to complete what should have been a simple task.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Caroline Z.", "time": "4/6/2016"}, {"content": "Simply the best bakery you will ever find. \u00a0Service is exceptional, prices rock and the baked goods will make you want to kick you mama! \u00a0Hats off to Vladamir who treated us like royalty.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "michael s.", "time": "12/1/2014"}, {"content": "I blame Porto's for having gained at least 10 pounds over the past couple of months. That being said.. I love them! We are always being catered by them for meetings so I had never actually been there in person. So I decided to go yesterday and check it out. Of course there was a line that snaked out the door. Of course I had to park way out there and had to walk a little bit. Was it worth it? Yes! I had the turkey croissant and some sponge cake fruit cup thing. I also ordered the chicken croquets and apple strudels for the homeward bound journey. It's always a journey if you are braving Los Angeles freeways. My friend had the chicken sandwich and a mojito. 22 bucks for 2 people.

I felt like we were walking into Grand Central Station with all of the hustle and bustle! We got in line (which went much faster than it looked like it would) and really didn't have enough time to figure out what we wanted to eat. I ordered the caprese sandwich and he had the Cuban sandwich. Both sandwiches came with plantain chips (which were okay, but not fantastic), and we split a strawberry banana smoothie. I liked my sandwich, but I wish that it had more meat on it. If you LOVE mozzarella, this would be a good choice for you, but it was more than I would've preferred.

This bakery is one of the biggest I've ever seen with two large pastry counters serving two humongous lines of Porto enthusiasts. The foot traffic and noise level was very high while the environment was festive but orderly in this late afternoon. There were more than a hundred excitable cakes and pastries colorfully displayed in the counter, and above it was an extensive sandwich menu calling my name. Completely overwhelmed by the size and scope of their operation, I didn't really know where to start until Anthony came over to help me to navigate through a long line of people that reminded me of LAX.We sat in a separated dining area where large paintings of freshly baked bread, good natural lighting, dark wooden decor and clean checkered floors added to the festive ambiance. I really enjoyed the Cuban style Pork Tamal ($2.05) which came with finesse buttery masa with traces of pulled pork unevenly distributed. The soft Pork Croqueta (90 cents) was equally mouthwatering with the melting croquet flashing with sparks of juicy ground pork.The Cuban Sandwich ($4.65) was served on Cuban bread with roasted pork, ham, Swiss Cheese, and the whole works stacked in between. The bread was pressed warm like a panini but the fillings tasted pretty ordinary. The side of banana chips was not greasy but light and crisp, and the Cheese Roll (70 cents) and Wheat Bun (45 cents) were just okay--too much air pocket and butter on the Cheese Roll while the Wheat Bun was not as moist and sweet as the ones at Sufficient Ground. I also had the chance to try the Guava Roll (75 cents), and thought the danish was decent.Overall, there wasn't anything that wowed or remotely inspired to proclaim this is the best there is. Readers should also be aware that these pastries couldn't keep its original shape, texture, or flavor on the next day. My fingers were filled with grease while the pastries were lumpy and gross when I tried the reheated version the next morning. Even though I respectfully disagree with 67% of the reviewers who had given this place 5 stars rating, I could see how this place could be a big draw in terms of offering an unparalleled level of convenience, cheap prices and selection. Service was friendly and efficient. I don't think I would deliberately travel across town to come to Porto's again but would be interested in returning only when I'm in the area. 3.5 stars for the experience.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Daniel L.", "time": "6/24/2010"}, {"content": "I don't know why I come here.. Oh wait I do! POTATO BALLS! Sooo yummy!! I love anything potato.. And this is amazing! It's like a rolled up Shepherd's pie. Meat filled mashed potato ball. My boyfriend likes the meat pie. It's a flaky layered pastry with meat. Almost the best thing ever! Their pastries \"are REALLY to die for\" as my previous friends/yelpers have stated. They are flaky, melt in your mouth and just the right amount of sweetness. I've gotten, of course, the infamous cheese rolls, guava cheese strudel and dulce kisses. One thing about the guava cheese strudel, it's not something you wanna eat as a grab and go. So much flaky goodness gets everywhere! I've tried some of their sandwiches with the \"marquitas\", plantain chips.
