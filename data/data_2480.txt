We also ordered a bunch of desserts, because honestly you can't go to Porto's and not have dessert!Now seating, was, well awful and difficult to find. \u00a0We were able to manage to cram 4 people on a small tall table. It was difficult to eat but we were able to manage, and given the yummy food, worth it.In fact, we had to go back after finishing brunch, we all went back into the line and ordered a number of pastries and desserts to take with us. \u00a0The low price of the pastries made it so that I was able to order a number of things and kept the cost under $20. \u00a0We took with us: chocolate chip cookie, apple turnover, mango turnover, mango empanada, cream horn, Parisian Indulgence (chocolate cake), Dulce de Leche Napoleon, fruit tart, and 2 chocolate covered strawberries.As always, amazing food. \u00a0Now if only they had this in Kansas City :P!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Caroline L.", "time": "12/12/2012"}, {"content": "Awesome food, crazy busy...but we'll worth the wait.

This place is intensely amazing! I had read so many reviews about the fab potato balls somehow I didn't see any reviews about anything else... To my pleasant surprise almost everything here is amazing!!! I even got the ceasar salad and it was delish! \u00a0Everything is also SUPER cheap. I bought a box of pastries filled with their butter cookies with the dolce de leche filling and it was I think like 3 bucks. amazing!

Top Three items are: Parisian cake (chocolate) you can order one slice of heaven or order a full size cake in advance. It's so delicious! Frosting is light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. Little chocolate shavings are a very nice touch. The cake itself is always moist. This one will expertly satisfy your chocolate craving. Number 2: cheese rolls. Flaky, sweet, creamy- imagine if a well made croissant and cheesecake had a baby. ;) one time I bought cheese rolls that were fresh out of the oven, still warm. I had a foodgasm because they were perfection. Number 3: walnut raisin bread. Freshly baked, buy a loaf and have it sliced. Perfect as toast with butter but even better for making grilled cheese. Use medium cheddar or Brie and a little bit of blue cheese. This bread has a slight sweetness and it's amazing when offset with savory tangy blu cheese.

My boyfriend and I came here and tried the opera cake, tres leches, cheese roll, dulce de leche kisses and some other chocolate nomminess I can't recall the name of. OH MY GOD. THOSE DULCE DE LECHE KISSES...so good I could cry. Total mouthgasm. They're these shortbread type cookies stuffed with the most mouthwatering, delectable caramel...you have to try them!

I actually went to this location because I was watching a taping of the Ellen show and was nearby. I don't know about the Downey (closest to me) location but this one was pretty big and spacious. With that being said, the line was still super long! There were 2 lines, 1 for the bakery and 1 for the food.My boyfriend tried a croissant and it was really good. I stuck to the bakery and ordered potato balls, cheese rolls, guava rolls, cheese cake.. honestly, the list could go on! I definitely recommend the potato balls and the empanadas though.

I circled around a few times until I was at the right spot at the right time--a car pulling out! score! free parking for an hour. today i tried the chicken croquette. I actually liked it better than the potato ball! Crispy on the outside, soft and creamy in the inside with pretty substantial chunks of chicken. Full of flavor. delicious!!
