I live in Las Vegas and I had to stop by here! I'm home now and missing it so much! The food is just so delicious! Everything, the coffee, the sandwiches, the pastries, just everything. I got the cuban sandwich, fhe white chocolate mocha blended and a chocolate croissant and fell in love. Then ordered a ton of items like the guava croissants, the cheese rolls, french bageit, slices of cake, etc. All for $28!! My mouth dropped when she only said $28. I had pulled out about $60 because that's how much I assumed because I got orders of dozen and half dozen. It's amazing how cheap it was and so worth it.
