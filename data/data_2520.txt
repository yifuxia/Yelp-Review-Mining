[{"content": "After reading all the yelp reviews praising the glory that is the Porto's classic potato balls and cheese rolls, I was determined to try them. So, off we went to Porto's to try these famed desserts. Yes, the cheese rolls and potato balls really are as good as people say. The talk is true. They were so melt-in-your mouth good. I was so pumped. Everything else on the menu looked pretty standard though so I wasn't too excited to get any of the other items. I just stuck with the cheese rolls and potato balls. The interior was definitely a maze so be prepared to look really stupid wandering around trying to find the end of the line on your first visit.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Melissa D.", "time": "9/23/2012"}, {"content": "Portos has amazing prices and the best pastries.....

And talk about a mess walking into this joint. I knew it'd be busy but talk about chaos with too many standing bodies and employees not knowing what to do with themselves.We tried phoning in our order prior to going to save ourselves a little bit of time. The first attempt we were either disconnected or hung up on. The second attempt we were on hold for over 20 minutes just to be told they don't take phone orders after a certain time. That time had passed because we were ON HOLD. Really?? It didn't occur to this business to notify the customer PRIOR to letting them sit on hold? Nice move. A simple recorded message or prompt would've sufficed rather than let me waste my time.So, we get there and the place is packed. To be expected but man is this place a mess. And for first timers quite confusing as most lines aren't clearly marked. We get in line and place an order for some pastries as well as some hot sandwiches. The girl disappears behind the counter for awhile and comes back with a loaded bag. We normally check our orders prior to leaving but given the chaos and how busy this place was we simply asked if it was all there including the sandwiches. She said yes, we were rang up and left with food in tow. We get to the car to discover, NO SANDWICHES! Had to go back in, find a clerk or manager to talk to and were informed we had to wait in a completely different line to pick those up. Seriously would've been nice if we were told this when we were handed our pastries.

I surely hope not.I know Portos has great prices and their food is still up to par...but it just seems that places like this, over time, have the greed factor kick in.
