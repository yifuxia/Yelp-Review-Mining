The cheese rolls are perfectly flaky with just enough cheese. I like the guava cheese rolls because I love guava. The media noche (midnight) sandwich is also delicious, but I get so full from the guava cheese rolls and potato balls. I buy enough to munch on while I sit (although seating it difficult to find because this place is always filled with people) and enough to bring home. It's a bit overwhelming for a first-timer, so I'd suggest grabbing a paper menu they have around on the counter and look through the descriptions. They don't have labels in the pastry case, so maybe another tactic is just to see what everyone keeps getting and get those things too.

The Chicken Empanada was a little dry, not nearly as good as the ones you can find at Mercado Buenos Aires. The stand out here are the Potato Balls. It's amazing.If you've ever tried Japanese Koroke, that's what Potato Balls look and taste like. Except whereas in the Koroke, ground beef and mash potato is mixed then breaded and fried. The ground beef here is the filling in the Potato Balls.Oh, one more thing... the food here is absolutely cheap.Meat Pies = $.78Chicken Empanada = $1.00Chicken Croquettes = $.90Potato Balls = $.90Hot Pastrami Sandwich = $5.25 - Pretty good amount of PastramiI ended up getting 4 of everything and 1 sandwich, 2 days worth of food, for $21.

What a bummer! That was on top of my list. But it was too late to go back to order. However the ones i got was so so good that i forgot not only his mistake, but also all the evils in the world.
