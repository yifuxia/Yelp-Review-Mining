You're coming!\" I've actually driven by the establishment a few times while going to and from Burbank Airport, but I'd never been inside. Man, if I only knew what I was missing out on!You should be aware that when standing in line to order your food you'll be placed next to some of the most delish looking pastries I've ever seen. \u00a0I wanted to eat all of them, but that would have resulted in either a food coma or sugar high - neither of which are conducive to getting work done.Porto's can get to be a busy place, but the lines moved quickly and there was enough staff to go around. \u00a0If you're having trouble finding a place to sit, just be patient - the staff pays very close attention to the patrons and makes sure that the only people sitting inside are people downing their yummy treats. Plus, it's incredibly affordable - you can get little savory bakery items, like their famous potato balls, for under $1. \u00a0Their sandwiches run from about $5-7 - I tried the Caprese sandwich today and even though I'm stuffed I'm about ready to go back and order five more.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Amanda G.", "time": "12/28/2010"}, {"content": "Porto's... A MUST!!I can't believe the fabulous food, mainly Cuban, and the unbelievable bakery. \u00a0fresh squeezed OJ, and great coffee drinks.My first time, and I can't get over how good everything was. Every ones food in my group was wonderful; full of flavor, not overpowering with seasoning or too salty. \u00a0All the meats had really good flavor. \u00a0I had the pork sandwich which was a huge sandwich on this fabulous fresh Cuban roll. The sandwich was full of really tender pork, It had their garlic sauce and saut\u00e9ed onions on it.The prices are so reasonable. \u00a0I don't know how they do it.The bakery part is truly unbelievable. \u00a0The selection of pastries, breads and cakes is incredible. \u00a0I brought home a box full of pastries and a loaf of sliced sour dough bread. \u00a0Everything was fabulous. \u00a0oh, how I wish I had bought more. \u00a0I live hours away.

End of story. When I first moved to Burbank I was afraid to go there because if you go mid day the line can be out the door. after hearing nothing but good things about it, I caved and went. I haven't had anything from the bakery that I didn't like. The prices are fairly cheap and while the line can get long, the establishment is properly staffed so that it moves fairly quick.The potato balls are amazing and I think everybody that goes there should try them at least once. They are lightly fried potato with beef and some sort of \"veggie sauce\" inside. other then that, all of their breakfast croissants are wonderful. I ordered exclusively their ham and cheese, which was also a good price. Their smoothies and orange juice are hand made and you can taste the freshness, so to speak. When I head back to California I will definitaly eat there every time! You should try it. Don't let the long lines intimidate you.

More ppl favor the dulce de leche kisses, but I prefer fruity flavors. It was delicious although could have used more raspberry filling. The cheese rolls and guava rolls could use more filling too.

I have experienced nothing but good stuff during my visits. On my recent kind of spur of the moment kind of trip, my family and I had a lot more time to stay in and just experience dine in. We actually ate a late lunch. On this trip, i was looking for their ham and cheese croissant because I had it last time and It was so good. Sadly, they ran out!!!! Waahh, but the lady advice me that I can still have the same sandwich but different bread and I chose their sweet bread. It was just as good, but not a croissant. I got to try their white mocha ice blended and it was really good. \u00a0It had caramel and chocolate drizzle on the side. But i felt like it was a bit watery and melted quickly. Service is always a rush thing because there's always a line. But remember everyone waits in line and when it's your turn give yourself time to pick and time to ask questions. They have always been polite though. A good way to save time is to go online and list everything you're going to get. I'm sure both the workers and customers behind you will be happy.

I've ordered cheese rolls, guava cheese rolls, danish trays, guava rolls... yeah, we like rolls. Also, they sell crafts of coffee for $12-14. Its a bit more than the crafts from Starbucks, but since you are already going to pick up baked goods at Porto's you can get the coffee here too.I like:The cheese roll: This item WOW's me out of the park.
