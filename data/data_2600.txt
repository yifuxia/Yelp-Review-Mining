I had a pastrami sandwich that was so good I was almost moved to tears. They were out of Apple turnovers (the main reason I even went) and had to get mango turnovers instead. Again so good I was almost moved to tears. It seems like anything negative about Porto's is negated by the taste of their food. I'm an extremely picky eater and I very rarely say a place is amazing but THIS place is beyond amazing.

That's at least 15 years of loyalty. The food, the pastries, the shakes & coffee never disappoint. Yes, the lines are ridiculous. Yes, it can be a bit chaotic. Yes, you may have to wait to get a table. Yes, parking is a pain. BUT, it'll be totally worth it. I promise you. Some of my faves:*Raspberry cheesecake*Tres leches cake*Guava & cheese pastry*Cheese danish*Quesdailla (the Central American type)*Potato balls...a MUST at every visit!*Meat pies*Mariquitas (plantain chips)*Steak torta*Bean soup*Horchata shake...to name a few.

Since I've devoted my other two reviews of Porto's to its ice blended horchata (you must get it), I'll also talk about some other foods here. People really recommend the potato balls... I find them a bit greasy, but they are pretty delicious. The meat pastries are so good. And so are their fruit tarts. Their classic caesar salad IS REALLY GOOD. And so is their Feta Sandwich. And Caprese Sandwich. Basically everything I've had here is pretty good. I'd opt for the more unique pastries they have here, instead of say, their muffins or coconut macaroons (although those are great, too!)The line and the drive are always worth the food.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Victoria C.", "time": "10/24/2012"}, {"content": "This visit was the best ever! It's super crowded (so plan accordingly) much like Pike's Place. This isn't Porto's fault, they're just super popular and awesome! I would venture a challenge to less than 3-star-ers due to the crowd. It's popular, people come from all over, if you don't plan it right, you'll get stuck in the crowd.

Ate here two days in a row because why not? Tried a lot of new things this time around. The chicken croquette looks similar to the potato ball but defs not as good, a little too cheesy for me, make sure to have liquids to wash it down with.Turkey and cheese croissant sandwich was good but nothing special, if it's your first time prob better to stuff your face with potato balls and pastries. Onto the ones I really enjoyed. Chocolate croissant, I mean, possibly the best two words you can ever combine together and it tastes exactly as good as it sounds. I got multiple danishes to take home, don't remember which ones but all were delicious. Finally tried the guava cheese roll which totally lived up to the hype. Guava smoothie may have been the best new thing I got to try, after a long night I usually want a smoothie to quench my thirst and this one was extremely refreshing in the heatIdeal situation for me would be potato balls, choc croissant, and a guava smoothie.
