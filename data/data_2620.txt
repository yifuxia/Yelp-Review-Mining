I brought it to the employees attention and he graciously brought me a new plate. When the employee brought the 2nd plate out the rice and beans were hot however the pork was tough like I was eating a pigs ear...Also my wife ordered a chicken salad that normally comes with tortilla strips.

After 6 hour drive from Norcal, my boyfriend and I made a pit stop at Porto's before heading to Anaheim. We got here as soon as it opened (6:30am). People were already lining up outside, but it wasn't as bad as people said it to be (probably came here too early). I was so excited that I didn't even know how the line worked. I guess you're supposed to wait in line until someone is able to assist you, instead I just went straight to the pastries and oogling them. The workers were very nice and helpful. I came in on a good day because they had a special on their Cheese Rolls (dozen for $8). I also bought a dozen of Potato Balls ($12). Their pastries was so cheap!! I wanted to try the slices of cake, but it was too early for that. They were so cheap compared to Ettore's in Sacramento.Cheese Rolls were freshly baked and it was nice & flaky. It has a coating of sweetness and filled with cheese inside. So delicious!I was a little surprised by the Potato Balls. I didn't expect it to have meat. My boyfriend said that it tasted like chili cheese fries. It was also delicious!Beware! Expect to gain extra pounds from all these delicious pastries.

The side to the left is for just sandwiches, and the side to the right is for everything else. The line is really long, but it does move fast. The people who work here know what they're doing, and they kind of have to considering how long the lines are.

I settled for ordering around 7-8 different items.The flan here is AMAZING.

It was mid June '12... and it was late afternoon which surprised me as to why it was so packed. Every hour, though, it seems this joint is packed. So we hopped in line. I figured out what I wanted, then watched the food attendants rush by with others' sandwiches and thought, \"Uh, no, I want that instead.\" How aggravating when it's so loud with people chattering and laughing and whatnot. So in hardly any time at all I was before the cashier. Gah! I settled on the hot pastrami, \"hold the mustard, please.\" It comes with plantain chips which were good, but I kind of wanted more crispy. My mango smoothie was a nice treat to beat the Burbank heat. Affordable lunch meals. The baked goods look pretty tasty, especially the Rustic Apple Tart.
