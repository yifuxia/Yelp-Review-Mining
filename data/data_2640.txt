The line was at least 30-people deep on a Sunday afternoon, and I had my order of 15 potato balls, a dozen guava cheese strudels and half a dozen cheese rolls in hand and out the door in under 10m. So many businesses (including their Downey location) could learn a lesson or 2 about efficiency from this spot. Oh in case you're wondering, I only ate ONE of the potato balls that I bought (for a party) though I could have eaten 3 more.The parking lot sucks but luckily I easily found street parking.

I wanted to get some cheese rolls before heading back home to Hawaii. My friend introduced me to their potato balls and the guava cheese strudel. Ohh Emm Gee, so goooood!! I wish I ordered more!! The potato balls reminded me of the zippy's chili and the guava cheese strudel remind me of zippy's apple napple.

Because I practically insisted. It's that good. The first time, we were walking around nearby and stopping into stores and when we passed Porto's, I turned to her and was all \"What is that heavenly aroma?\". So we just HAD to have an impromptu snack. We each got a potato ball (pure awesome: fried potato balls stuffed w/ground beef, cheese and yummy sauce), and we shared the rope vieja sandwich (shredded beef, peppers and onions on Cuban bread). I fell in love, and the next day when we came back to meet friends for lunch I had the exact same meal, except I had my own sandwich this time around and a DELICIOUS macaroon for dessert.Be prepared for (somewhat controlled) chaos if you come during prime eating hours. You wait in line, order and pay at the counter and then get a number which you take to your table so that they can find you and bring you your food. I was skeptical because the place is huge, but they seem to find you and deliver your meal with uncanny precision and speed.I'm super sad I live across the country from those potato balls and that sandwich. It'll have to be a long-distance love affair for now.
