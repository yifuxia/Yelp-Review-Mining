[{"content": "I've had Porto's baked goods but I had never really stepped foot in their establishment until just recently. They handled the holiday rush really really well!! The cheese rolls (FAVE!) are amazing, as are their croissants. I also brought back the potato balls but wasn't too keen on them. Prior to leaving, I ordered their chorizo and egg on cuban bread. First of all, the breakfast sandwich is huge! They also give you some strips of fried plantains on the side. I also tried their dulce de leche latte and really enjoyed it!

But their sandwiches are such a disappointment. Thin and lacking meat, they really just feel like Porto's cheaped out on giving you any quality so they could have a lower price or something. Its barely above something you would get at Jack-In-The-Box, just on a little better bread. Their cuban sandwich is a joke if you've had a real cuban, there is none of the care or steps taken with their cuban (such as grilling the meat, serving it warm, etc) that is traditional. Portos has great chicken empanadas and the potato balls are wonderful, as are their tarts, desserts and pastries.

The line moves very quickly, for they are rather efficient beings! :O While we were ordering, my friend expressed curiosity over wanting to try the meat pie and the guy ringing up our ginormous order said, \"You want to try it? Here!\" It was pretty awesome. :OTo continue, the potato balls are amazing! How are they under a dollar?! I also had a chicken croquette, a chicken empanada, half a steak torta, and half a grilled chicken sandwich without the mayonnaise. Someone was also coming by with free samples of a pastry, so I ate that too. I got the guava smoothie and sampled the mocha and the green tea (noms!) since my friends ordered those. :D Their dessert collection is frighteningly ginormous and everything looks pretty amazing. o_o I sampled the caramel eclair and the sally something muffin cake, and I'm pretty sure that the last time I came here, I had the apple strudel.
