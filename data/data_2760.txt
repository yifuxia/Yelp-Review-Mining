[{"content": "I always loved Porto's food and service. But this last Thursday after asking for my usual double expresso I noticed that the amount of coffee was equal to a single expresso. I'll tried to talk to the older gentleman \u00a0that is always at the front door greeting people, the one wearing a white shirt, and he was surprisingly rude. He started to explain to me the amount of coffee that a single or double expresso takes, when I tried to tell him that I come from a country where we drink lots of expresso so I know expresso, \u00a0he rudely interrupted me shouting: \u00a0\"I don't care where you come from\".

The Cubano sandwich was really mediocre with the bread bordering on stale and the filling not all that substantial at all.I bought a bunch of breads to take home and while they were decent on the day, (I was told they would be perfectly good the next day and even edible the day after) but the next day, the bread lost their desirability and had to be toasted before they were good enough to be consumed.The salads here aren't bad, and the chicken Caesar was rather good in fact, with the chicken pieces well-seasoned and all, but the portion size was meager for the price you pay.Those famous potato balls really disappointed. I've tried them on several occasions and they were greasy and not hot anymore having been cooked and sitting around a little longer than they should have.I have however tried their cakes and the cakes are pretty darn good. They aren't super sweet and the best part is, they aren't super expensive either. Still, I would not make a special trip just to go to Porto's because if you did, you may feel that this place does not live up to the hype.

I love them. I recently ordered a fruit tart here and it was amazing. My friend ordered a generic white cake with less than 24 hours notice and they were able to accommodate her and the cake was amazing also. However, I've had the potato balls and I wasn't so much a fan. I guess to each his own. I'm not a fan of the fact that the lines are so long here no matter what time of day you go, but I do need to try actual food for me to really form a real opinion of this place. The parking here sort of sucks too, but is better than the Glendale location since Glendale requires pay to park and parking here is free. Although the lot gets full quick so waiting for a spot is most likely going to happen here. I also hate the fact that people find the need to cut in line or one person comes to hold a place in line for 10 of their friends and family who all order separately. I was victim to one woman that felt she should just walk right up to a register in the pastry department and tell them that she was there to pick up her cake, while the rest of us were all in line picking up our phone orders too. She was told to wait in line. This place also has plenty of places to sit too so finding a spot to sit may not be easy, but people are always finishing up so finding a place should come pretty quickly.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Hailey Z.", "time": "6/10/2012"}, {"content": "The only thing that stops me from going here every day of my life is the line.
