[{"content": "I truly do not understand the hype over Portos. \u00a0I've wanted to like it. Being new to the area from out of state, all I've heard is how amazing it is; how everyone loves it; how \"you must\" try it. \u00a0I've given it three tries, and it's no gem. \u00a0First, the lines are insane, and the first time I went, I waited twenty-five minutes in the wrong line. \u00a0(Sorry, this is not \"wait in line for twenty-five minutes food. \u00a0Just not.) Once you know the system, you realize that it's just as screwed up as you initially thought it was. \u00a0(For the record, be aware that the counter goods line goes to the right, the cafe beverages in the center and the prepared food to the left.) Second, this system isn't as efficient as it should be. \u00a0Twice now my order has been forgotten. \u00a0This means that after I've stood in a ridiculously long line, I've stood around or a ridiculous amount of time waiting for my food. Today, I finally went to the counter and asked the facilitator if I'd been forgotten. \u00a0I got the same answer I got the last time, \"Oh, your order was next!\" \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0Sure. When I got my food home, less than five minutes later, the Caesar salad was warm and wilted. \u00a0Gross. Third, there is an odd inability to actually to LISTEN to what's ordered. \u00a0I ordered a Cubano...I got a veggie. \u00a0I ordered dressing on the side...I got it loaded with dressing. \u00a0Fourth, the desserts are ovvvvvvvverrrrated. \u00a0Most are waxy, and cheap tasting. \u00a0They look gorgeous; taste meh. \u00a0Not a worthwhile expenditure of calories.The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because I do think their Cubano is good (not great...not life-changing, but good.) Their triple chocolate mousse is good. \u00a0Their iced tea is great. \u00a0(But how irrelevant is iced tea anyway?)So, seriously, how is it possible that everyone in the greater Los Angeles area thinks that this place is so amazing? Overall, it's a disappointing cash cow. \u00a0Someone's living very well off this place that never ceases to be busy. \u00a0Good for them. \u00a0They have a fantastic scam going because somehow they've convinced the masses they're stellar. \u00a0Well, not me.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Rachel H.", "time": "7/6/2016"}, {"content": "Love this place. I always try to visit when I'm in the area, or driving through. There's nothing comparable on my side of the valley. I'm waiting for they day they open a location in the west valley.

If I can blame anyone for my weight gain during my previous job it has to be solely Porto's. My previous employers loved Porto's and it made into every staff meeting and every celebration event. But it's not my fault! Those darn cheese puffs are so good! I was probably the heaviest during this time, but in all jokes and fairness Porto's is an amazing bakery. I absolutely love their cakes and their artisan breads. But you know what I am starting to dislike? Their darn potato balls. Those are not as good as I once thought they were. I rather just stick to the baked goods than their deep fried stuff. Oh and you must have their cubano sandwiches. Yum! The lines are always long, and avoid it at all cost during a holiday's eve.

My family and I ALWAYS make a stop here before we go home to the Bay Area. This bakery is only located in Southern California and with only 3 locations! Oh, how I wished the Bay Area had one. Their CHEESE ROLLS are to do die for and super delicious. Better yet they're addicting! This recent trip of ours we left with 7 dozen of cheese rolls! Each dozen is $6.99 or was it $7.99 either way it was well worth it! \u00a0Yes, since this bakery is popular the lines can be pretty long, but be patient! It's worth the wait! I normally order their pork tamales (delicious) and love their briouche. My sister ordered their apple turnovers and thought they were a bit dry. I know that means she's not eating the other one. We also ordered the potato balls and it's flavorful and good! Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone who loves sweets or looking for great baked goods.

If you live in SoCal and you haven't been to Portos, then something is wrong with you! My uncle usually brings cheese rolls and guava rolls to our family parties. They are always delicious! However, I have never actually been to Portos myself until recently. I stopped by with some friends since we were craving potato balls. \u00a0I ended up ordering potato balls, a chicken croquette, and el medianoche sandwich; which is similar to a cubano but it's on a sweet roll instead. The potato balls were yummy as usual. I was quite disappointed in the chicken croquette as they had described it to have chunks of \u00a0chicken in the middle but the croquette was just all potato! How disappointing. The medianoche was delicious. The pork was tender and flavorful. The pickles cut through the fattiness of the pork which was great. The bread was soft and sweet and buttery. MmMMMmmMM. I was also surprised by the complimentary banana chips they served with your sandwich. \u00a0One of my friend ordered a ham and cheese sandwich was he says was the best he's ever had. My other friend ordered a few potato balls and meat pies. There's always a line due to its popularity, so be prepared to wait!

By then, the potato balls and croquettes weren't at their best. They tasted similar with panko bread crumbs.
