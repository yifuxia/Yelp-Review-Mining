On my last visit I got the Tres Leches Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Tiramisu, Oreo Cheesecake, and some sort of Dulce de Leche pastry and they were all excellent.I also got a small chai tea ice blended which was super yummy.

It's always going to be crowded so if you have a big order do yourself a favor and order ahead. If you actually want real food, the sandwiches are also very good.

It's so worth waiting in line. What a great excuse to bring a friend along so you can chat with while waiting. \u00a0I wish they had more seating area like the one in Glendale because it was difficult to find seating area inside and outside. \u00a0Nonetheless, a nice bus boy found an open table for my friend and me so we could catch up on life while I enjoyed their delicious White Chocolate Mocha drink.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Stacey C.", "time": "5/6/2012"}, {"content": "Food is 5 stars for sure.

Porto's is amazing, it's a bakery on steroids! You got the bakery on one end and the cafe on the other. They have different lines for everything, pre-order, bakery, cafe, etc. They have to keep it efficient here because so many people come here, sometimes I feel like I'm at Disneyland with all these lines. This place is great for ordering cakes and for catering orders as well. I would probably avoid eating here because its just so crazy, no peace and quiet. I always get the cheese rolls here, they are so addicting and love the potato balls as well. The parking here is terrible, small parking lot, they should really make a structure, that's how many people come here. Overall, I look forward to going to Porto's.

My favorite foods here include cheese rolls, guava cheese rolls, dulce de leche cookies, chocolate chip cookies, mango empanadas, meat pies, potato balls, southwest salad, cheese pineapple Danish, mango smoothie, croissants, and fruit tarts just to name a few. The prices are very reasonable but it's like the dollar tree. You think, \"Oh, it's cheap. So let me get a dozen!\" And then you spend $40-100.

I'm so glad I don't live near a Porto's or else I would turn into a porko. Ha. Ha. I'm clever.Anyways.... Cubano. $4.85 I think. HUGE cheap delicious. Soft fresh bread, salty meat, melted cheese, sour pickles. I LOATHE pickles but the sandwich was just perfect even with them. Yummy plantain chips that aren't super sweet or oily. Southwestern grilled chicken salad: Fresh greens, moist flavorful chicken with a nice spice crust, creamy ripe avocados and damn good dressing. Now on to the next one... onto the next one... somebody bring me back some money please! Any Jay-Z fans out there? Cheese rolls: Crispy flaky outside with a sugar glaze and just the right amount of not too sweet cream cheese filling. \u00a0Guava rolls: Buttery crumble-y outside and sweet/tart/tangy filling.Guava cheese rolls: Jeebus. The best of two worlds combined!Chicken empanada: Needs more filling but this was just ok. I did like the raisins in it though.Meat pie: Buttery crust and rich meaty filling. Again needed more filling but still good.And now, saving the best for last, the infamous potato balls (beef). Perfectly fried crispy outside, buttery, silky, smooth potato surrounding juicy, well spiced flavorful ground beef with minced peppers. Grab some cute little to go Tapatio's, drench that bad boy and enjoy the ride into Fatville. Side note: I'm determined to learn the recipe for those damn potato balls! Then I'm going to take over the world with my delicious fried balls of heaven!!! Or hog them to myself and become obese.
