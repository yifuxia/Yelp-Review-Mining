I feel like everything I visit here in LA I HAVE to go here. This place is amaze balls for those that go gaga pastries and desserts.

I can't believe we found this restaurant. It is the restaurant of all restaurants ever in life. If this place existed in San Diego, I would probably eat here daily. At first I was a little skeptic when this place was a bakery, and we were heading here for dinner. We got here around 6pm, and there were still pretty big lines. I was a little turned off at first. We waited in line (which went by very fast) and we ordered some tasty sandwiches. The staff were very patient and they helped us out as this was our first time. I ended up trying the following:Steak torta - wow this was a great sandwich. This thing is loaded with meat and the best part is the fresh bread. This place can do no wrong when it comes to the quality of their food. Pan con bistek - I ended up trying this and again, this place has some great quality ingredients. Everything inside this thing makes you want to come back for more.Laredo Omelette sandwich - Wow! Can you say wow! This was probably the best sandwich I had here. It's basically what it says it is, an omelette in a sandwich. The beans and pepper jack give it a good kick. Chorizo and egg sandwich - I ended up trying a bite of this and I was impressed that they can do a great chorizo. Don't be expecting some mexican chorizo - this thing had some chorizo the size of small hot dog bites. If this place opened up chains all over the world - They would be on TOP of the world. Oh and not to mention the amazing deserts here... I tried everything here! Muffins (bannana, blueberry), All sorts of pastries (The cheese pastry is to die for). Even the tiramisu was the best I ever had. Here is the break down on the joint:The Fat: Excellent quality food, great customer service, great layout of the actual restaurantThe Skinny: At times you can wait 10-15 minutes in line, No Salsa! I wish this place had an awesome spicy salsa -- it would make it even better!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Juan R.", "time": "4/10/2013"}, {"content": "The Cheese Rolls are the BEST and are a must try!!!My family also loves the potato balls (filled with beef) and ham croquettes (similar to potato balls, but with ham instead of beef). The pastries are delicious. There is a wide variety of sweet and savory pastries, as well as sandwiches, drinks, cakes, cookies, and much more. Keep in mind though the line is always long, but it moves pretty quick.I have never tried the cakes, but I have tried the sandwiches, and they're pretty delicious! I had the ham and cheese croissant, and they're served with banana chips! Its sort of like potato chips, because the banana flavor isn't strong, but I thought it was pretty interesting. The service was great and quick. The servers are friendly and do a great job in keeping the line moving. This place is recommended for those who want to grab a quick bite or drink. There is indoor and outdoor seating.

So me and my best friend went in and tried their Cubano Sandwiches and mariquitas plaintain chips!! Let me tell you something in one word - DELICIOUS! I am addicted to their Green Tea Smoothie!!! and their potato balls are amazing as well as the New York Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cupcake, Peanut Butter Cookies, and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.

The parking situation is atrocious during the busy lunch hour, but well worth the event of searching for parking to get their delicious treats, sandwiches and drinks. Don't let the long line fool you as they are quick and besides, it gives you time to absorb your situation, gather your thoughts and figure out what to get.With the numerous time being here, I've tried many of their options such as Guava Cheese Strudels, Guava Strudels, Cheese Rolls, Potato Balls, and obviously their cakes (my workplace always gets cakes here for birthdays and it seems birthdays happen on a bi weekly basis).Definite get what I mentioned above, but if you are here for an actual meal try the Feta sandwich by adding grilled chicken or the Pan con Lechon. That is real good! Also get their fresh o.j. to accompany the main item, something really special about that.

Thank you so much to Tabetha and the team at Porto's in Glendale! Seriously, I have been dreaming of this cake throughout the entire year of planning and the result was exactly what I wanted.
