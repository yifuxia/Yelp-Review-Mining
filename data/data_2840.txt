I'm still awaiting the bolt of lightning that's bound to hit me, since there's no way--a few weeks later--I actually got away with eating so much delicious food and spending so little.I had a tuna croissant sandwich that I seriously could've paid for in pocket change, plus a Caesar salad and a slice of cheesecake to take home for dessert. I think in total it was $8 or something like that. Seriously? I thought I was going to have food poisoning because that was just so ridiculous. But everything was tasty and fresh.The only drawback to this place is it gets stupid crowded, especially at peak hours (brunch). We walked in at 3 p.m. or so and I thought I was at Disneyland. Families, families everywhere. But if you can handle the claustrophobia of a crowded bakery, plus the inevitable wait for your food to be ready, it's worth it.And if anyone knows a good time to show up here without the place being inundated, please let me know.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Molly K.", "time": "11/20/2013"}, {"content": "My last meal in SoCal was Porto's because I knew I had to save the best for last and it was my boyfriend's first time! It was around lunch time and the line was packed. I ordered the steak torta, a cheese roll, a potato ball, and a mango smoothie while my boyfriend got the cubano sandwich and a cheese roll. Steak Torta with plantain chips - Although I didn't really care for the plantain chips, I thought they were just okay. The steak torta, however, was really good and satisfied my torta craving. It's not the best torta I've had (Bakery Mexico in San Jose has the best in my opinion) but for under $5 I was thoroughly satisfied. Cubano Sandwich - I don't really remember much about the Cubano except for the fact that it was flavorful and delicious.Mango smoothie - Mm, so sweet and refreshing! I'm not too sure if they use real mangoes, but this smoothie was delicious and perfect for my meal! Cheese roll - Ah, the famous cheese roll. It was a perfect dessert for our Cuban meal! It was so fluffy, had the perfect amount of cream cheese, and had a nice glaze.Potato Ball - The potato ball was interesting. It was like a deep fried mash potato ball with meat in the middle. It was definitely a weird combo, but very good.The prices are ridiculously cheap which made my visit to Porto's so enjoyable. I brought home 4 boxes of cheese rolls for the family and they loved them. :)", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Joyce E.", "time": "7/24/2012"}, {"content": "I can't wait to go back to Cali in a couple of weeks and hit up my favorite Cuban place ever!This place is amazing.
