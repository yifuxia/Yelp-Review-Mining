[{"content": "Can you believe I've never heard of Porto's until yesterday?! On a roadtrip back to the Bay, my friends and I stopped by Porto's to grab some bites. My friend was raving about their potato balls, so I knew I had to try some.And try some I did! Wow -- were these things good! At only $.90 a pop (I love how cheap this place is, after sampling far too expensive and not very good bakery goods at other places), you are certainly getting your bang for your buck. I bit into one, and the crispy outside danced with the soft, warm potato-y goodness on the side. And what's this?! Chili on the inside?! My -- it's like an inside out chilli cheese fry!I was overwhelmed with all the things this place had to offer, so I only chose a tiramisu as well. Hands down, one of the best tiramisus I've ever had. Usually tiramisu is far too sweet at other bakeries, but Porto's got it down pat. Creamy and chocolate-y with every bite. Mmmm. Only $3.50 too!I will be sure to purchase more the next time I come!

I exaggerate, of course, but the numbers are pretty darn close. For just 85 cents, you can buy this delectable little puff pastry similar to a French-Vietnamese pate chaud, but with a much more satisfying meat-to-flakiness ratio. The filling is a Cuban-style seasoned ground beef... reminds me of a taco filling, in the best way possible. For a weekend brunch, I'd skip the lunch menu altogether and just grab 4 of these.Then the desserts... oh what colorful, sinfully tempting treats await in those glass displays! The Oreo cheesecake (not too sweet or too dense), the apple/cherry double Danish (although I prefer the cherry.. they pop when you munch on them!), and the chocolate mousse have all been great, but I recently discovered my personal fav - the milk & berries. It's served in a cute little plastic cup with layers of cubed white sheet cake (although admittedly the cake tasted a bit stale when I had it...) and fresh berries, all swimming in a bit of milk. Reminds me of a light and fruity tres leches... with just one leche. MM always gets the caramel eclairs. I love how the topping isn't that melted caramel frosting but rather crystallized melted sugar. It adds just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. We're not above snaking past a few indecisive customers to snag the last of the eclairs.And since I had to wait in such a horrendous line anyway, I usually grab a baguette or two to bring home for the week. I also love to admire the displays of whole cakes - I can definitely see why some people would get their wedding cakes catered here.Definitely worth the wait and the occasional clusterf*** in the parking lot. And everything's so cheap!! I would be set for life if only they would open a branch on the westside. All three locations are at least a half-hour drive away for me, but so far I've managed to find reasons to make it into a convenient stop (ok fine, just one reason: IKEA).", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Alice H.", "time": "7/22/2011"}, {"content": "I can not rave about this place enough. I also can't believe I haven't written a review until now. \u00a0They are always busy, but the line moves very fast. No matter how busy they are, we never pass it up. I have been here on multiple occasions. Every time we get the potato balls for our pre meal. DELICIOUS! Fried potato balls with seasoned meat inside?? How can you go wrong! I have tried the Mango smoothie, so refreshing! I always get the Ropa Vieja, either in a sandwich, or dinner style with beans and rice. My husband is Cuban, and used to make this meal for us. Porto's did not disappoint! I normally always pass on the pastries, just because I am too full after my meal. One occasion I did try the guava strudel, which I heard they are famous for. I guess I am not a huge guava fan. Other than the guava flavor, it was delicious and flaky!The thing we love the most is it is fresh, close, and has lots of parking (even if it is on the street, it is not hard to get to), and you can't beat the prices!!!

Last night, I also tried a little rum-soaked cake with the consistency of bread pudding. It was good but not amazing. I've also had Porto's larger decorated cakes, which are not only sumptuous but also stunningly gorgeous.I've never bothered with a sandwich or other savory meal. This is a bakery first and foremost.
