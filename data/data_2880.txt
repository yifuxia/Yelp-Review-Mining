[{"content": "So I love this place, the food is bomb that's why I gave them a 2 star. However the lines are so long.they are out the door and there's someone who's letting the same amount of people exiting to enter. I felt like I was going to a coach event. I placed my order for pastries and a GRILLED CHICKEN sandwich. When I got to work I opened up the sandwich and found a beef sandwich. Sooooooo disappointing!! Its not even that good. I ate it because I was hungry and I work too far to go back, 30 minutes. They need to pay attention to the orders since my receipt clearly says GRILLED CHICKEN not beef.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Michelle R.", "time": "8/24/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "One of the best dessert places I know.

Delicious varieties of sweets and quick bites. Love it. The only down sides to it: parking sucks; it's always busy, and you can rarely find a seat if you choose to eat in.

Just the fact that it's a Cuban bakery caught my interest right away! I've heard so much about their cheese rolls, guava cheese strudels, and of course their infamous potato balls! So going to porto's was definitely a must on my list to do when my family and I made a trip to LA for a wedding this past weekend. At first, when I first stepped in to the bakery, I was amazed (and intimidated) by the long lines. I was also confused with why they had two lines on both sides, so I asked a worker. One line is for those who already know what to order, and the other was for those who don't know and are more of a point and \"I want two of these please.\" It being my first time there, went to the line of the \"I don't know what I want.\" The place is big! Enough to accommodate two large lines, and even a dining area. \u00a0I was expecting to wait in line for a long time, but I wasn't in line for no more than 10minutes max! I didn't mind the wait because I was so appalled by the display of pastries and cakes, I was too busy taking pictures on my iPhone of them and pointing with my family saying were going to get those for sure! They have about 15 workers on that one line so they are constantly saying \"next person please!\" they are quick with their service and have such great memory with what you want to order and DON'T give off that \"hurry up and pick already\" vibe. They are super friendly, and I even noticed that they always get the freshest batch of what you order (if available) and even scan through that specific dessert you want for the best looking one (which is by far one of the greatest customer service quality in my opinion!) The prices are so cheap! We came home with 10 different types of desserts/pastries, ordered 3 dozen of the cheese rolls&guava cheese rolls, a dozen of potato balls, four smoothies and even a whole fruit tart cake and we spent less than $75!!! The whole middle seat of our car was full of boxes. Their pastries, desserts, potato balls, and fruit tart cake are to die for!!!! The bread and filling ratio with the cheese and guava strudels is perfect! The bread is light, but buttery, and crispy. Still good when it's room temp! The potato balls are heaven in the mouth. We have meat empanadas in our culture, so it somewhat similar... But not! I only ordered a dozen of them, and I really wished I doubled my order!They really need to build a Portos here in NorCal. Because I am three guava/cheese strudels left and zero potato balls (and we just bought them yesterday), and I am already thinking of finding a way to make a SoCal trip just to get more. I have never been so addicted to something so simple as a potato ball. Haha.5 stars forsure!

After paying and taking my order home I open the bag to find one coconut macaroon (I hate coconut) and a guava pastry.

It really, really pains me to do this, but I'm downgrading my review severely --- not due to the quality of food, but the quality of customer service.This past Sunday, I decided to mix up my usual order a little and order a mango smoothie and went to wait with the rest of the crowd.The first moments of waiting weren't too bad, many of my friends had also ordered smoothies and were waiting with me. Some of them started getting their drinks...By the time 20 minutes rolled around and people with much higher numbers were getting their drinks, I didn't want that smoothie any more, and went back to the register to request a refund. The people behind the smoothie/coffee/juice bar looked extremely stressed and busy, but offered no apologies or explanation for the obvious issues they were having. Some friends who went to request a refund 5 minutes before me had their drinks handed to them at the register. Sadly, this wasn't the case for me. As soon as the manager behind the cashiers saw my receipt, she rudely told me to go back and wait with the rest of the crowd without listening to a word I was saying. I was steaming. It was then that the guy behind the drinks counter announced that smoothies were going to take another 10-15 minutes. 10-15 minutes on top of the 20 minutes I had already waited. Who wants a 30 minute smoothie??
