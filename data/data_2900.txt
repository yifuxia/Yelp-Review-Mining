Their pastry selection is massive and range from Cuban classics like guava pastries and dulce de leche to bundts and tarts. It's all so unbelievably good and their fresh breads are magnificent.

Had a pastrami sanwich, light on the mustard, w/ plantain chips, and it was very good and fresh. \u00a0Had a potato ball (haha, ball) and it was so good, could eat that everyday, every meal and I would die happy of a clogged artery. Stopped back before we left town, to pick up some desserts to go. Had the strawberry shortcake, light, airy, and delish. Beyond the food being great, I think what I enjoyed most was how happy and fast \u00a0the employees are. They were super helpful, even though they were going through that line of ppl sooo fast. \u00a0Also got a plaintain stuffed black bean thingy (sorry, i don't know the name), it was also very good, but the forever fatty in me went with the fried balls instead (haha balls).

It was the new Garden Salad. For the price of just under $4, it was a nice size and had all of my favorite ingredients (blue cheese, pecans, raspberry dressing). I hadn't yet been to the actual location yet.Fast forward to about 20 minutes ago. My roommate and I were heading home after an early morning boot camp session. Our favorite boba place (Frootsii - see other review) wasn't open like they were supposed to be, so we needed someplace to replenish our calories. Being only 9 a.m. options were limited. I made the executive decision to go to Portos. It was as busy as I suspected it would be. We waited in line and were rushed through our orders only to be kept waiting when it came time to pay.My roommate ordered the only vegan sandwich option and after being scooted around to different registers, they told her they couldn't do the vegan sandwich because it wasn't 10 a.m. yet. They suggested an alternative and she agreed assuming the sandwich would have an assortment of veggies on it. She also asked for wheat bread instead of french loaf. ---When she received her sandwich, it was literally just french bread (not wheat like ordered) and tomato with a few small slivers of onion. They definitely had lettuce available. They definitely had peppers available. Why wouldn't they include such basic veggies? My roommate decided it was the biggest waste of $6.Then it was my turn to order. I only have one real option at this place because EVERYTHING has gluten in it. You'd think a bakery as big and popular as this would have more gluten free options. I ordered my usual salad, the Garden Salad only to be informed that they don't have that salad until 10 a.m. (it does NOT say that on the salad menu) but suggested I order the small side salad instead.Me: \"Well, what does the side salad have on it?\"Dumb Worker: \"Oh, it's the same as the garden salad just smaller.\"Me: \"That sounds pretty dumb, but sure whatever.\"And it was. The smaller side salad was exactly the same as the big salad. Soooooo, why couldn't they make the big version? My side salad was half the price and half the size of the bigger salad. So I guess if I ever decide to go back to Portos (unlikely) before 10 a.m. I will know to just order two of the small salads and pay the same price as the big salad and enjoy the same amount of food for the same amount of money without confusing the incompetent employees.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Elizabeth O.", "time": "3/22/2013"}, {"content": "Breakfast here is always a win!

I waited in line, and the first thing I said when I got to the server at the counter was that I have a large order to place. The server nodded, smiled and awaited me to start telling him what I wanted. I proceeded to go through my 8 person order with various substitutions and side dishes added. I guess that servers here aren't allowed to write things down when you order, because mine didn't make note of anything from my complicated order. The server then took me over to the cashier and tried repeating my order to her from memory. There were a handful of mistakes interspersed that I caught, he \u00a0also omitted a few side dish items (soups and salad) that I had originally asked for when ordering which I didn't notice until I was unpacking the food, and thus I didn't get them in the end. Maybe it would be smarter if I could just order directly with the cashier first instead of having to be part of a game of broken telephone?I had to wait about 20-25 minutes after ordering my food for it to come out. Other than the wait, the missing food items, and that they forgot the dipping sauce with the plantain chips, the food was still delicious. I will still come back...
