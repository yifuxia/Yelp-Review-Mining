They have so many staff members making sure things are running smoothly. The guy who helped me out was really friendly and helpful. I had many questions about their items and helped me choose a soy/dairy free drink even though the place was packed and busy he was attentive. I tried once again the Guava pastries and they are so delicious! As well as the potato and meat croquettes. I don't know if they do but they should offer some sort of dipping sauce for those croquettes. For the first time I tried the meat pies and empanadas and a chocolate croissant. Love it all especially the meat puff pastry and the croissant is to die for. The ropa vieja sandwich is delicious and the horchata soy latte I had was good but didn't really reming me of horchata may due to the espresso shot but still yummy.

Do I talk about their delicious one of a kind mouth watering potato balls? Their made just right cubano sandwich? The guava cheese pastries YOU APPARENTLY CAN'T GET ANYWHERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA? The plantain chips that took me awhile to get used to but now I crave?...I guess I'll just start talking about how much I love the tiramisu here. It's perfectly layered with just the right amount of everything. I'm not going to lie though, every now and then I feel like they over powder the delicious thing but once I get past all of the coughing I've realized that I'm wrong. I also love that all of their deserts are perfectly packaged so there's no mess or fuss. The potato balls... too good to be true. HOW?! how do they make each and every one so perfect? I still can't wrap my head around how that's possible. I've tried a few potato balls here and there but nothing compare to the ones here. I love that they never taste too greasy and that the meat is always cooked perfectly. Try it with the tapatio on top.. it takes the potato ball to another level. Honestly, because I live in the Bay Area, every time I have the chance to come to Porto's I take at least a dozen back with me (and fight with my partner over who gets to eat the remaining ball). Someone please FedEx me a few!The cubano sandwich with the side of plantain chips... I don't like pork or butter but this is the only time I'll eat it either and not care. Why? Have you tasted the sandwich? it's impressive as hell. Every bite is so flavorful and leaves you wanting more. I always want to get out of my routine of ordering this sandwich but I can never get away! The. guava. cheese. pastries. OH MY GOD! I did some serious Yelping up here in Northern California and came to the conclusion that they don't exist up here (Unless someone knows of a place that I don't know about and if you're that person MESSAGE ME RIGHT NOW). At first I was like \"ew guava cheese pastry?\" but one bite later I was hooked. The flakiness, the sweetness, the everything. ALSO HORCHATA SMOOTHIE HORCHATA SMOOTHIE HORCHATA SMOOTHIE! The only way to top off a great meal!I know this will never happen but I really long for the day that Porto's makes its way up to the Bay. Maybe I should move to LA? Maybe right next door to one so that I can do a daily worshipping ritual of eating a guava cheese pastry?", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Carla L.", "time": "4/19/2013"}, {"content": "Came back to try their sandwiches, teas, and a few more desserts. \u00a0We got into the cafe line which was unusally short for a Sunday and as usual, the line moved very quickly. \u00a0We ordered a cubano, medianoche (a cubano made on a hawiian type bread instead), tiramisu and flan. \u00a0The cubano was good however next time I'll stick to just the meat pies and potato balls, especially for the price. \u00a0We enjoyed the selection of flavored teas however, the only sweeteners available were Splenda and raw sugar. \u00a0I am a fan os Sweet and Low so I was disappointed by that. \u00a0A note for those wanting to sit and eat, you must get a table number before you can sit which are available from the cashiers AFTER you pay. \u00a0At first I was concerned that we wouldn't find a table however, there is someone who sits you so it wasn't a problem. \u00a0The tiramisu was disappointing and it was quite expensive compared to their other desserts.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Maritza P.", "time": "3/22/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}]
