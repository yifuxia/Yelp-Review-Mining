Amazing food, and wonderful service. Everyone has a great attitude and the service is very quick, from \u00a0my experience. Great outdoor seating and lots of space inside.I've been to this location over 50 times and it's always packed. On the weekends it's usually so busy I don't bother. I wouldn't say this is a downside, I just wish they'd open more locations. The Potatoe Balls are my favorite snack.

We were down in Burbank for two days and came here twice. The food is very good. The staff are friendly, though on my first visit they missed one of my items on the order and so I had to re-order it after realizing it when the rest of the food came for my table. The lines can get quite long (though they move pretty fast, so don't be afraid). And I could imagine parking in their smallish lot could be an issue - though for us it was not as both times someone was leaving just as we came. But apparently this place is so popular that I can understand that people likely could park a block or two away and it wouldn't deter them in the least!

I thought Panera Bread was pretty decent... until I met Porto's. I love everything about this place.. the cathedral-like exterior, the high ceilings, the friendly service, and of course, the food. We ordered a roast pork sandwich, which was a pretty big sandwich, but a bit bland for my taste. I absolutely love the potato balls (fried potatoes with beef inside), chicken croquettes (kind of like fried dumplings with chicken), and the cheese rolls. Although fairly greasy, they are just so delicious.. :)Parking is in a lot adjacent to the bakery.
