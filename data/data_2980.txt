I love the Cuban sandwich & their fruit cocktail cakes:) I had a massive fruit cocktail cake for my birthday last yea. Oghhh, it was enough to serve 25 people. There were endless portions of different fruits on there such as strawberries, kiwi, mango, blueberries, mandarin, grapes (both green and purple), apple, pineapple, and this creme filling to support the fruit. It only came up to be around $85.00. It was worth every single penny :) I don't recommend you come here on your 30 minute break. The wait in line alone is pretty much around that time.

As soon as we entered, we were greeted and given a menu. The sandwiches are very good. Their desserts are why everyone comes here. Now i know why. The desserts are wonderfully made and very cheap. \u00a0This is how they get you. You end up buying several delicious desserts and getting a box for them. \u00a0Its so worth it. \u00a0Another great feature is that there is no line for ordering only coffee and beverages. \u00a0You just walk up to the counter (by-pass the long line) and order your drink.
