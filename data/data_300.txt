I've only been to the one at Glendale and this one by far my favorite location. Plenty of parking and its a bigger bakery! I'm sorry but the guy that helped me I don't remember his name but he was very helpful and great customer service! I understand it's always busy everyday thre but the workers all still manage to have a smile on their dace and that's what I love most about. Came here and of course I had to get 4 dz cheese rolls it's the most popular thing in their menu and it's just so good had to get a dz for my family & I and the 3 dozen were to share with my coworkers. I also got other pastries like apple/pineapple turnovers, passion fruit pastry, chicken empanadas, fruit danish. All I knew everytime I come here I am set on getting cheese rolls and I make my decision on other pastries I want to be added the thing is once it's your turn you blank out because you see more pastries and you blank out and overwhelmed with all these deliciousness! Oh yeah we got a spinach pastry it tasted real good! Everythings good here I cannot say enough things on how delicious this place is.

I'm very impressed with the quality and price. The line was extremely long, but it moved very quickly. I ordered and iced coffee with a blueberry muffin.

I'm a lover of sweets. Can't really beat the prices either. There was plenty of parking, but of course it was a Sunday morning.

I cannot for the love of life, hold myself back from overbuying here. There's something about their pastries that just makes you want to eat more than one. For example, I tend to buy 6-10 potato balls, 6-10 cheese rolls, 6-10 guava cheese rolls, and everything else every single time I come. Excessive? Yes. Problematic? No, because I instantly become everyone's best friend when I go home... At least until the Porto's runs out. So in case you don't know, everything here is awesome. Definitely get potato balls and cheese rolls when you're here, everything else (pastries, sandwiches, drinks, desserts) are left up to your discretion. Don't be fooled by the \"long line\", it moves pretty quickly and the servers are very efficient. So all of this sounds fine and dandy except... How much am I gonna pay?$20. I pay $20 for enough pastries to last me a week. That's how cheap Porto's is, a potato ball is a little under a dollar and cheese rolls are like 78 cents each. So it's no wonder why it's so easy to overbuy and still not go broke.I just wish there was a Porto's closer to where I live.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Derek T.", "time": "1/20/2016"}, {"content": "Always long ass lines food is hit and miss so it ain't all that ... but the milk and berries cake off the hook", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Inan S.", "time": "11/25/2016"}, {"content": "From the moment my neighbor brought me pastries from this shop I knew I'd found a match made it heaven.Flaky crust,guava filling, and cream cheese...what's not to love?But then as we walked into this bakery, it became so much more. \u00a0If you are going here for lunch, have a plan before you walk in, one person to order, the other person to scout out seating because when I say this place is popular, I'm not exaggerating, it's a madhouse (but it such a good way) \u00a0and its up to one of you to claim your space.I ordered the Italian sandwich which was loaded with Ham, Genoa salami, mortadella, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and Italian dressing, on ciabatta bread... the cheese literally was fresh and creamy, just delicious and it was so big I could not finish it, \u00a0the sandwich was accompanied by homemade banana size chips, they were thick and were seasoned to perfection, it was a great contrast to the flavors of the sandwich. My friend had forgotten to get me a drink when she ordered and felt terrible about it, when the server came to serve us, she explained what she'd done and he took care of it for us so we didn't have to get back into line.While the Cafe is busy, everyone is is excellent spirits... I wonder why? \u00a0Could it be the awesome food, I think sooo!If \u00a0you are in line for ordering the baked goods, they have a person stand in line overseeing to make sure you are helped, they will tap you on the shoulder, \u00a0on the off chance you are overwhelmed (moi) and point you in the right direction. \u00a0So for anyone whose never heard of Portos... make a point to check it out, and add it to your bucket list.

Raised in the nation's city that atleast 90% of the population are Cuban, Hialeah is that city. Enough about me, PORTOS!!! My friend from here in LA took me to portos knowing about my culture and asked me to check out this spot because he thinks it's the best Cuban food he's had in LA so he brought me to Portos where I was happily surprised.The place is huge, it's a bakery, breakfast, lunch, and dinner restaurant. All in one! As soon as I got to portos there was a line wrapping right to the outside of the building which was crazy to me! I never would've thought people would wait in a line that long for food. To portos credit, the line moves really fast, they have a lot of employees actively working and helping get the orders out as fast as possible. Place is usually packed at all times from what people told me so keep an eye out for empty seats and tables if you're going to eat there. The restaurant itself is huge so I'm sure you'll come across a table or two. I ordered a grilled chicken plate with rice, beans, maduros (fried plantains) and everything was as authentic as back home. Each bite made me miss my Cuban mother's home cooking. This place is legit! Prices for everything are very affordable, quality food for prices that fast food places charge. I'm happy I found a Cuban restaurant that keeps my cultures cuisines alive on the west coast! P.S.

Lines are long no matter the time of day but it moves along quickly. Plenty of seating inside/outside. Prices are decent with the infamous cheese roll being 75 cents and potato ball 98 cents. I only got a chance to have the cheese roll and potato ball and both were good but prefer cheese roll. The cheese roll is super flakey and light without being dry/oiley. The cheese isn't really a chedda/american cheese but more of a cream cheese. Definitely worth a try! The potato ball is fried with a mash up of potatos which was not bad.
