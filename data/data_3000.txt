I also ordered meat patties (I don't normally eat meat, but these were fantastic) and an apple strudel. Both were really good. And crazy cheap. Like less than $1.00 each. My boyfriend said the French roast coffee was great, too. And he's a total coffee snob. At first, we were wondering what they were giving away because the lines were so long.

We came here last weekend and there were a ton of people! Parking was extremely difficult - on the street and in the Porto's parking lot. We were lucky because the Parking God's smiled down on us and we scored parking on the side of Porto's Bakery. When we entered it was packed to the gills! Being the die hard Yelper that I am and having waited 90 minutes to check out what the fuss about M&M donuts were waiting in line at Porto's Bakery for 15 minutes was a breeze.We ordered: Guava RollsCheese RollsBlended MochaPotato BallsHam & Cheese CroissantsMy relative recommended the Potato Balls and they were amazing (Thanks, Mariecris!). The Potato Balls were made lightly deep fried- the mashed potatoes were fluffy and the savory ground beef filling was melt in your mouth delicious. The guava rolls were underwhelming this time around- won't be getting those again. The cheese rolls were still omgoodness delicious! The Ham & Cheese Croissants were the best I've ever had- perfect ratio of ham & cheese. They make the most delicious iced blended mocha drink.Overall, Porto's makes the best baked goodies ever. They take pride in their product and it shows in their quality of product. If you're in SoCal this is a must stop.

I currently live in Boston but am from Los Angeles. Whenever I go back to LA I drive the 30-45 minute commute (one-way) to Portos at least once or twice a week.2. I bring Porto's for myself and my roommates (who I introduced to this heavenly bakery) on the 6 hour plane ride back to Boston every time.3. I asked my mom to bring some Porto's when she came to visit. One of my roommates said that fighting over the (day old) leftover pastries was not pretty, perhaps a Hunger Games-esque scene. 4. My brother hates to leave the house when he is on vacation. Like will refuse to go anywhere with me...EXCEPT Porto's. 5. Here is Boston \"Porto's\" is equivalent to \"Voldemort\" in the sense that it shall-not-be-named due to the intense cravings and uncontrollable salivation that ensues. Now enough about that: TO THE PASTRIES!-Almond Danish: My favorite thing to get at Porto's. There are not nearly enough reviews on here about it. The sliced almonds add the perfect amount of bite to the flaky, buttery pastry shell that encompasses the sweet almond filling. It's always a sad day whenever they don't have it in store. Seriously, it is a must-try!-Chocolate Croissant: How many times have you been to a coffee shop and gotten a chocolate croissant for 4 dollars? Um, try less than a dollar fifty! Not to mention the chocolate croissant at Porto's is huge and better tasting. -Cheese Rolls: Everything that everyone says on here about the cheese rolls is true. I can't even add anything else to the description. DELICIOUSNESS!-Fruit Tart: I am a sucker for fruit tarts but Porto's definitely outshines all others by a mile. If all fruit was like those on Porto's fruit tarts then I would be the healthiest person alive. Just saying.... plus the custard is perfect, not too sweet and the texture is divine. - Iced Mocha: Okay, so it's not a pastry. But after being in Boston and having coffee from Starbucks all year round, it is such a beautiful thing to be able to come here and have the best Iced Mocha around! I'm not even kidding. My roommate is from NJ and I took her here...she said it was the best Iced Mocha she's ever had. We drool about it on a daily basis. Perfect balance of mocha, coffee/espresso, and milk. Plus, they don't put too much ice in the drinks! How refreshing is that to hear?I always want to try some new pastries but I always get dragged back to my favs. Ugh, probably the worst part of Porto's: choosing what you want. Then again you could probably get one of everything since everything is so cheap!The people that work there are the nicest and most patient people ever. Plus the line....Psh, if people can wait in line for a Justin Bieber concert for 5 hours you can wait 15 minutes to experience heaven on earth. Just go to Porto's already. Before I ramble on and on some more and short circuit my laptop from the drool dripping down to my keyboard.

This sandwich was probably the best part of my day, maybe even the week. The pork and ham were perfectly cooked and filled with so much flavor. Their mustard and mayo mix along with the cheese just makes everything phenomenal.
