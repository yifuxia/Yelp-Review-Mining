Fresh squeezing oranges if you're in the mood. For me, the Dulce De Leche latte is the best thing on this menu and even worth the $5 price tag.Sandwiches are good, but i don't think I'll coming back for them. Other places do breakfast and Cuban better. If you find yourself going to the left for the sandwich line, it will likely be to get the savory treats like the potato balls.What I come here for is that beautiful bread and sweets section to the right, just look for the line. If I lived closer, I could probably control myself and just get a few treats and breads to go. However, making a 100mile drive just for this place, I come with a bigger budget and go wild. Everyone has their suggestions about what to eat, but I say let your eyes and stomach be your guide.

I think they have everything you can imagine from sweet and savory. I came here because my nephew mentioned that they had the best cheese rolls that he received from friends who had traveled down to So. Cal and brought them back. They were closing at 7:30pm and we arrived at 7:15. I'm thinking we better hurry so we can get in and buy some goodies to bring home. The parking lot was packed but I'm thinking that there must be other restaurants in the area that uses the same lot. When we enter the store...... holy cow! It was also packed with so many people doing the same thing we were. It was like being in line for a Disney ride. I'm thinking that they better serve me because by the time I get to the top of the line, it's going to be past 7:30 - everyone out..... It wasn't like that. They were very accommodating. I asked about the cheese rolls.....realized I was standing right in front of them. That's how overwhelming this place is. The young lady asked if I wanted to try one. I thought they would have sample pieces to try. No wrong - she grabbed one out of the case and let me have the whole thing. I probably could have asked to sample a bunch of stuff until I was full and said \"OK thanks but I think I'll pass\"......I ended up bringing home cheese rolls, tiramisu and apple turnovers.

Major oversight on my part. This is one of my all time top EVERYTHING restaurants for the obvious reasons of 1.) The food is DELICIOUS 2.) There is a huge variety and 3.) It is insanely cheap. I'm a gluten avoider, but oh god, you KNOW when you see that elegant Porto's box that you WILL be eating whatever is inside, and it will be worth it. Their pastries are all so delicious, wonderful croissants, interesting guava confections, and as for the cake, hands down THE place to order for birthdays, I've never had better icing, it's creamy and light, not that sickeningly over sweet garbage you get in many store bakeries. I have never been able to resist a Porto's cake.It is also a killer place to grab lunch. I adore the Porto's salad. With avocado and mango dressing (and I add chicken) it is perfectly satisfying and with a drink is still solidly under ten bux with tax. Chicken is thinly sliced but moist and a few strips of fried plantains add a nice crunchy finish. Mmmm.Word on the street is that the empanadas and sandwiches are good, and I've had an awesome egg sandwich on one of those pretty croissants for like three bucks, so, solid choice for brekkie.

This is a delicious Cuban restaurant that bakes their bread and pastries fresh. I first had Porto's catered and once I had it, I needed to come to the restaurant. I love the guava cheese pastries, turkey croissant sandwich (flaky croissant and generous amounts of turkey), and potato balls. The medianoche sandwich is also tasty. All the sandwiches come with plaintain chips. If there is a long line, don't despair. There are always a ton of people working and the line moves quickly. There are also separate lines for cake orders and beverage orders. Take a dessert to go- you won't regret it. When I went to my friend's birthday party, he had a dulce de leche cake from Porto's. I thought I died and went to heaven. There are two locations- one in Burbank and one in Glendale.
