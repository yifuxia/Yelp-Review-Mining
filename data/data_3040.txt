Every time I am in the area I am sure to make the stop.Sure there is always a long line, but it does move VERY fast.If you are in the mood for something a bit hearty, I STRONGLY recommend the Machaca Burrito. It is simply amazing. The beef is so tender and juicy, onions and peppers cooked perfectly (softened but still with a slight snap). The flavors will make your mouth water. Again it's amazing.Looking for some dessert? Now we're talkin'! The Red Velvet Cupcakes are so good. And they put a red Rose Petal on top, a nice touch...... It helps me get out of the dog house when I manage to get in it........ Which is often.No visit would be complete without a dozen Cheese Rolls. These flakey little cheese filled pastries are so incredible. DO NOT make the mistake of only getting a couple. You will be sorry tomorrow. Trust me, I'm from the Government and I'm here to help. :-)Now a lil hint. This place has the most incredible Blueberry Muffins on the planet. They are great for breakfast or a mid-day nibble, but for a real treat, try this.Heat up your Blueberry Muffin in a toaster oven or regular oven. Get it nice and warm with a slight crunch to the top. *Note* do not use a microwave, you will loose the slight crunch factor. Next cut your toasted muffin in half from top to bottom. Then take a scoop of Haagen Dazs French Vanilla Ice Cream and place it on top of your two cut halfs and enjoy!.......... Haagen Dazs Vanilla Bean works well too.........

LAst time I came, I decided I was going to try their food and get some sweets to go. I had the Pan con bistec - or something like that and it wad delicious. I also had their house soup which often changes. I think it was some sort of potato soup which was really good. All their desserts are yummy and very inexpensive.

I like this location better than the one in Glendale because it's not only closer, but it seems to be less crowded and faster service.When I came here for the first time, I thought I was in heaven due to the ridiculously huge area where they display all their pastries, desserts, cakes, etc... My inner fatty instantly came out and I ordered one of everything.This is the cheapest bakery I've been to, but I spend so much money here because everything is soooooooooo delicious. The large cakes run around 20-25, which is pretty dang good.Recommendations:1) Guava Cheese Strudel2) Cheese Rolls3) Chocolate Croissants4) Potato Balls - i get like 4 or more5) Meat Pies6) Chocolate-covered strawberries (can't ever go wrong with these)7) Breakfast sandwiches with egg- yummm8) Cuban sandwichThere's more, but I can't remember.

I walked in not knowing how big this place was. It is huge, and there were tons of people during the lunch hour. There were two different sides, both had a line. I honestly didn't know what I was doing, so I just chose a line to stand in. It moved fairly quickly which was good because I was starving. I had to try one of their sandwiches, and there was a lot to choose from. I ordered the potato ball sandwich, well because potato balls sound absolutely delicious, and you can't go wrong with having it in your sandwich. I also ordered some pastries to bring back home. Inside my box was potato balls, cheese rolls, and guava rolls. My bf ordered a pastrami sandwich as well.The results: My sandwich was a bit try, so it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. My bf's sandwich was really good! The pastrami was super juicy and flavorful. The potato balls were good by itself, not so much in my sandwich. The cheese rolls were good but not my favorite since it was sweet rather than savory. The guava rolls were actually really good, and I'd definitely get more when I'm in the area. Overall, Porto's is a great place to get a quick bite for a extremely low price. The line can get long, but it isn't a pain waiting.

It's the bee's knees, the cat's meow, a beautiful gift from Cuba. The potato balls and cheese danishes are my personal favorite when it comes to pastries on display. It's just so fresh, crisp, and the cheese is oh so thick and creamy. I am drooling thinking of it. The potato balls are crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside filled with meat, veggies, and of course mashed potato. SO GOOD. On a nice hot summer day I definitely recommend the guava smoothie. So refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. I need one right now.
