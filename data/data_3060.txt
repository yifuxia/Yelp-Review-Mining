However, plus 27 stars for everything else. Its a cuban bakery done in a way that is always amazing. There are 2 sides, the, for lack of a better term, 'food' side; and that bakery side. The food side has sandwiches and wraps and other fun stuff, which is above average but not the best you've ever had. The real secret to the place comes on the bakery side. They have some of the best and most imaginative things you could think of (and then like 50 you cant). The hot, fried stuff, is epic: potato balls, empe\u00f1adas, etc. All amazing. The sweet stuff is great too, there's a guava, goat cheese danish that'll haunt your dreams. Oh, and it's cheap, like dirt cheap. The potato balls are like 10 cents each. You can get so full that you'll throw up for like $4.

I hit this place up every time i fly into the local airport to visit friends. I have not had a single item here that I did not care for, from their lunch meals, to their decadent desserts, to their AMAZING potato balls.It's great that the place has parking. I've only been here once when there were no lines, otherwise, be prepared to wait for a while before it's your turn. not always a bad thing, as lines like this indicate the quality of the food and everyone's desire to have it.i've been here a dozen times and only once have encountered the not so helpful employee. wish i could give 4.5 stars, because the food itself deserves 5+.

If you get it to go, it gets all soggy and gross. Plus you don't get those banana chip thingys. Are those plantains? I gobble all those up without even knowing what it's called. Please excuse my vulgar ignorance. I also recommend the Caprese sandwich that is only available at this location now which is so stupid. I like the Turkey Croissant sandwich too. Potato balls are quite unique but I know not everyone will appreciate them. I guess it's all personal preference.I bought a Napoleon which was super sweet but I liked it.Prices have gone up so I'm a little salty about that. The parking and the lines there can be ridiculous so be wary. I sometimes park on the streets like a rebel but I don't recommend doing that. I am pretty sure that one day I will have a curse put onto me by the residents for parking in their street. Most likely I'll get a ticket from law enforcement.
