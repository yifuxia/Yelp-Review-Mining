[{"content": "I don't care, I'm in on this hype. The fam and I came here before the dinner rush and it lived up to the rave reviews for us. I had the basic Cubano with a Horchata smoothie. The smoothie was a bit too sweet for my liking, but the sandwich was delicious! All sandwiches come with a side of plantain chips, which are crisp & savory.The potato balls are the staple to any visit to Porto's, so we had to try those out. Very rich in texture and the taste is similar to a taco, hehe. I can probably just eat 2 max. I also tried the chicken croquette, which is pretty good too (but I prefer the potato ball more). One thing I regret not trying are the cheese rolls. :( ...but I'll definitely ask a friend to order a few for me if they're visiting Burbank.COME TO NORCAL, PRETTY PLEASE?", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Theresa T.", "time": "7/21/2011"}, {"content": "\"Onions With The Feta?\" Full eye contact. Pause. I rear back with hands up to signal \"slow down.\" More eye contact. \"Onions With The Feta?\" That's how the 15 year old worker greeted me. I was behind a woman in line, she left, I stepped up, he made eye contact and still kept up in his haste, which we can over come young man, I believe in you. So, he's the clerk under the sign that reads: \"Take Out / Pick Up Area.\" Keyword: Area. Area denotes I place orders at this window rather than wait in the other line, which isn't designated as anything de facto. I knew going into Porto's was going to be a very line & order focused situation, so that was the whole attempt at this Take Out Area & Kid. Maybe I'm too obsessive with signage (I think I am) & correct directions (I'm German) because I couldn't handle the chaos in the face of so much possible order. Back to the kid: immediately after the second Onions With The Feta command / question, I breathed deep - held up hands & said, \"please slow down, let's start this over.\" His reply: The line's over there. The line's over there. I tried once more to say \"hold on\" and he dismissed me. He had pimple-sized diamond earrings and diamond-earring-sized pimples and I wish I was describing in detail like I am the intense bold flavors of these pastries. I had to leave. I couldn't handle this kid. I think I've got a lot of learning to do before I have a 15 year old son because I really, really want to handle him enough to where I get to my pastries. He flustered me & destroyed all my patience & hope.

Surprisingly, the tart cr\u00e8me to fruit ratio was perfect, even with all that fruit on there! 3) The crust was just perfect! Buttery, crisp, and a perfect compliment to the tart and fruit. It was hard not to pick the edges off and eat them by themselves! 4) The fruit: can fruit be soft and crisp at the same time? Well, they proved it can. The apple slices on the edges were perfectly crisp, yet had a pleasantly soft texture. The texture of the pears, when put in your mouth and your tongue rubbing up against the roof of your mouth with the pear in between can only be described in one word: \"MMMMmmmmmm\".

Today was the first time I came to the Burbank one (I always go to the one on Brand in Glendale). This place is nice! It's definitely newer and the space is a lot nicer. The line also seems to move faster here than in Glendale so that's yet another plus.Must-orders at Porto's are their potato balls (which also have meat, SO DELICIOUS) and their cheese rolls (I brought a dozen home with me today). They must have increased the prices on their cheese rolls since I don't remember them being 70 cents before but hey, I still ordered a dozen AND two potato balls for under $10 so I am a very happy eater. Other must-tries are their guava cheese pastries and their chicken croquettes. That's a relatively new discovery for me and I love them!They have so many other pastries and desserts that look amazing and their sandwiches are great too (my fav is their Medianoche).

If you want something that they need to make more of, expect to be forgotten by the person who helped you.

There were not enough out to fulfill that order so they told me it would take \"10 minutes\" before they had another batch ready. So the person helping me had me wait while they helped the next customer in line. Only five minutes go by and another employee comes out with the chicken croquettes and starts filling their display bin with them. I try to get her attention and tell her that I needed 9 to complete my order, but she looked at me like I was some sort of alien and just left when she was finished. I then tried to flag down another dude who just glanced my way and went about his business, retreating and hiding in the back. I actually had to ask a cashier and finally she was able to fulfill my order. Food is great, but the service and customer attendance is terrible.
