[{"content": "Been coming here for close to 10 years and it's still as great as it has ever been. Expect large lines and crowds of people so try and come during non-main meal time hours. You will probably wind up waiting at least 15+ minutes but it is worth every minute of waiting and more. Parking sucks in this place, so if you're coming north on Hollywood Way, there's lots of street parking so I usually park there and make the short walk instead of trying to navigate the minuscule parking lot. The service is also awesome here. The staff are super friendly and attentive!Food-wise, you HAVE to get potato balls and cheese rolls. It's pretty much the staple of this bakery and if you only have time to try this place once in your lifetime, make sure to order those. They had a special going on for a dozen cheese rolls for $8. Best $8 dollars you can spend. I've tried various other pastries, some decent, some average. Their fruit tart is top notch! With such a wide variety of sweets and baked goods, there's bound to be something you like.If you're buying a sandwich, TRY and eat in the restaurant and not to-go. The reason being you get your sandwich delivered with plantain chips! Nice light crispy chips, AMAZING! (If you get your sandwich to-go, no chips sorry). My sandwich of choice is always the medianoche (midnight) sandwich. Stuffed with slow roasted pork, ham, cheese, and pickles on a sweet roll, hands down one of my favorite sandwiches in Los Angeles. Get it, try it, love it!TLDR: usually long waits (BUT WELL WORTH IT), small parking lot, MUST ORDER potato balls + cheese rolls, recommend the medianoche (midnight) sandwich and eat IN restaurant so you get plantain chips, great staff!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Alvin C.", "time": "2/14/2013"}, {"content": "This bakery is simply out of this world. Porto's should be the definition of Fresh. or Fresh should be the definition of Porto's. I figured it was like any other bakery. There's a uniqueness to this place like no other place I've ever been. You can find everything you desire in this bakery and more. Many concoctions of pastry you wish you can get to know.If only there was a Porto's up in Norcal.We had their potato balls, cheese rolls and other goodies I couldn't remember the name to. The place is great for breakfast, lunch, brunch. Always busy but the lines moves quite fast so just when you think you have enough time to pick and choose from all the variety of pastries and desserts, its your turn to pick from the millions of selections. I literally felt like I was a kid in a candy shop. There's something for everyone. The quality is beyond satisfactory. After eating my food and having a few to-go's boxed up. I walked out the door regretting I should of got more to go. And I did. So if you're in the Los Angeles area and happen to stop by here for lunch, don't hesitate to spend a couple of bucks for road food. I sure wish I did.

They ended up putting mayo & mustard on it anyway and I complained, but they let me keep the old sandwich, made me a new one, and threw in an extra danish for free too! I also ordered a feta spinach croissant but the employee said it would take a few minutes so he would bring it out to me. He ended up forgetting so he gave me two extra ones! So in one visit they made two mistakes, but I ended up getting a free sandwich, a free danish, and two free feta cheese croissants. Nice!!

Amazing inexpensive food. \u00a0I went here for breakfast for the first time on my last trip to LA. They were busy as usual.

Well, Porto's would be Burbank's featured bakery and cafe, and probably has been. I love almost everything about Porto's and have secretly fantasized about taking a job as a counter worker there just so I can witness for myself how the massive operation works.My favorite menu items are the potato balls, cheese rolls, steak torta, and media noche sandwich. I have also been known to pick up a chocolate croissant or perhaps a sliver of cheesecake. In the cake section, you must try the Grand Marnier chocolate cake. It is the best of its kind.So why 4 stars? Well, Porto's has failed me in one major area: the specialty cakes. I ordered a 1/4 sheet type deal and it was honestly very average. I'm talking Ralphs quality. I can't understand how they could fall so short in this area, when everything else is so good. I hope I go to a birthday party some time soon, bite into a delicious cake, ask \"Where'd you have this made?\" and they say \"Porto's!\" Otherwise, I don't know how I'll ever find out if they DO improve their recipes.Actually, this review made me crave a potato ball...", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Nancy D.", "time": "1/21/2013"}, {"content": "This place will give you diabetes or heart attack, do not come here if you're on a diet.

You drink one of these and you can never go back to Starbucks.-Breakfast plate -- yummy, Spanish twist to the normal American-style breakfast.

They say ordering more than a dozen needs to be called in. I ordered 2 dozens and when I got there, asked if they can add another dozen to my order. They were pretty accommodating (there was still a line at the pick up counter tho) so I was in and out of there as fast as humanly possible.
