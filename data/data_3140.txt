The good & bad about this bakery....everything is affordable. My 2 pieces of deserts came out to less than $5.

One of the best restaurants and bakeries in the Valley if not the entire county. It's about Cuban sandwiches but they may as well be American for as familiar as they are. Cheap too. That explains why there's always a line out the door and the dining room, even though they've expanded to as much capacity as they can, is always packed. I've driven by the place at 6 a.m. and there's already a line forming to get in. I honestly haven't had a lot of the desserts, since they would take way too long to acquire and that's a deep dark hole of sweet goodness to fall into, but I did have a cake from here once and it was the best I've ever had in my life. I recommend anything with the potato balls, especially the sandwich (despite how bad they are nutritionally). Save up a deficit of calories and make sure you have as many as you can put down.

However, that should in no way take away from the strength of this review. Porto`s is like stepping into a Wonderland. I don`t look anything like Alice but I sure as hell can eat HER under the table! The selection at Porto`s is almost too good to be true and in typical Burbank-style, it`s oozing with pizzazz. This overgrown patisserie has spirit along with anxious energy...anxiety and anticipation.So many choices of specialty cakes,tarts, breakfast sandwiches. Seemingly infinite possibilities have your neck on a swivel. Although we settled on the slices of both the Pina Colada and Italian Cheesecake, these were not my first choice;more like the fourth and fifth(choices).
