Okay fine, the line can get a bit obnoxious at times, but they move at a pretty decent pace and the attendees are always friendly and helpful.Although I can see how some people might get bewildered and even overwhelmed over the chaos that is ordering from all the delicious looking items behind the counter.It's hard to choose just a few since everything looks so good. I generally go with the mainstays such as the guava and cheese pastries &potato balls and then pick a few other treats. While I generally stay away from cupcakes - as I'll leave that to specialty shops. It's hard to go wrong here really - I've never had anything bad yet. Wait no, I take it back: everything I've ordered has been very good~!One of \u00a0the best part of this location is convenience IMHO. There's a dedicated parking lot right next to it and it's so big.

Everyone raves about the potato balls, and yes, those are great, but they have so many amazing things it's worth while to broaden your horizons and try other things!

I was immediately impressed by the size and the service.

Although there were two separate lines with a good number of people in each, because the lines moved fast, I didn't have to wait much. I told the worker it was my first time, and so he offered samples and was very helpful and friendly! I didn't feel rushed, and I was surprised that he gave me a full cheese roll (instead of a small bite size) to sample! I felt like I was talking to a good friend who was hooking me up with the best experience at the bakery. His friendliness definitely bumped my review for this place from 4 stars to 5 stars. I bought potato balls, cheese rolls, and guava cheese roll, and my favorite out of the three is easily the cheese roll!!

I drive for this place. First, the bakery...if you like baked goods, this will be the devil on your shoulder because everything looks SO good and decisions will have to be made. My bakery staple has been the sprinkled butter cookies, but the sugared shortbread cookies are placing a close 2nd for sweets to take home. For a small afternoon treat on the premises, I recommend the Mango Mouse and one other item which I did not cach the name of. It is a light cake drenched in a sugary syrup and it is heaven. Porto's also makes one of the best Carrot cakes I've ever tried and the pastries....The Guava Cheese pastry is infamous and once you try it, you'll understand! My biggest dilema is that Portos (any of the 3 locations) is a drive, so there are just some things I would love to purchase and bring home, but I know that they won't make it since there is frostings to consider. But, Porto's is a great place to have lunch. They have very reasonably priced sandwhiches (under $5 for a Croisant Sandwhich or a Cubano) which are tasty, made fresh and to order. Don't forget a side of Plantain chips with garlic - oil dip...YUMMY! If you can find a place to sit, you can people watch and refill your fountain drink. Of course, if time or seating is tight, you can get it to go. \u00a0Parking can be rough - especially on a weekend.
