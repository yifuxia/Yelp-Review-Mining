Ordered the potato balls separately and inhaled them ASAP while waiting for my sandwich. Since I was craving potato balls pretty crazy this past visit, got the medianoche preparada which is a midnight sandwich with potato balls stuffed inside! Really gives it that extra kick.

What started as a crush last year when I had a taste of their cheese rolls, turned into a serious obsession now that I got to visit the store ;)You'll only find two types of pastry here: ones that are good and the ones that are effn DELICIOUS. There is nothing not to like about this bakery. It is spacious, service is quick and super nice, and it is cheap! I came out with 26 pastries and 2 drinks for only $30! I got a variety of pastries to taste but my absolute favorite are: cheese rolls, guava strudel, pork tamale, potato ball and the apple empenada. I seriously just want to go back right now and get all these items again AND try everything else! Don't forget to get a refreshing mojito to wash down the delicious goodness!It's a little crazy inside but the line moves so fast and the workers are very nice and efficient!
