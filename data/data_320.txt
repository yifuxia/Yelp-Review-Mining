It's one large room with a pastry/snack area on one side and a full eatery on the other.Come here and you can get anything and everything. Come here for a quick snack by grabbing the fried bites like croquettes, potato balls, empanadas, etc. Come here to get the delicious guava cheese and cheese pastries.

She gave me a smart response saying \" you should have asked your server\". I said really they are right there shouldn't be much of a problem. She then charged me for my cake and I left extremely unhappy after waiting in that long line which I know many of you know that Portos always has long lines.

I haven't tried much else in terms of food, but if everything is as good and as cheap as the three I mentioned with extreme excitement at the very beginning of my review, then you really can't go wrong here.I did also get an iced horchata latte when I was last here, and initially it was TOOOOOO sweet and very thick (which is weird to describe a coffee drink? but that's how it was). But it was more manageable after the ice melted a bit. Not sure how the other drinks were, but I would proceed with some caution after that experience.It does get very crowded!!

I am guessing it's because they reached maximum occupancy. A fire hazard, I suppose.When we got in, there are two lines, the left is for the deli & bakery & the right is 2 lines, one for the bakery & one for just whole cakes that have been pre-ordered.The line moves pretty fast because all what seemed to be 50 employees behind the counter moved like a well-oiled machine. People know their job & do it well. Great training Porto's! When I got to the front of the line, apparently they ran out of Cheese Rolls but owuld have some in an hour. So I ordered the Caprese Salad & a blended white mocha. Larrs ordered a Guava shake & it was BOMB! The blended white mocha was super sweet, the way I like it!My caprese sandwich was good, the bread was a bit too crispy for me but I'm not complaining. I ate the whole thing :)Went back in line to get the fresh cheese rolls & O M G, straight outta the oven!Their seating area is regulated very well so we were able to nab a seat for 6 people no problem.All in all, great service & AMAZING food, makes this place what it is.I will for sure be back, FOR THEM CHEESE ROLLS!

Parking here was kind of complicated. Some parking lot don't look like they belong to Porto's but people still park there. Space is limited. It took me 10 minute to find a parking. The line looks pretty long but it goes really fast because there are many staff help taking orders. One side is bakery and another side is sandwich section.My favorite was of course their cheese roll. It was sweet and cheesy. I also enjoyed their potato balls and guava roll. However guava roll was kind of too sweet for me. I LOVE their guava smoothie. It is super refreshing and not overly sweet. i can taste the fresh flavor of guava. One thing I want to mention is there plantain chips. I have never tried plantain chips but this came with sandwich I ordered so I had some. Ever since I tried I start begging my BF to buy more plantain chips for me since he goes back to South America sometimes. \u00a0I always leave here with huge smile on my face because Portos always satisfy my sweet cravings.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Yushan W.", "time": "11/18/2015"}, {"content": "I love Portos!
