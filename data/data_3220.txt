That's how happy. I hit up my pal, who is full Cuban, for recommendations.

Roasted pork and sweet mustard on sweet and soft Cuban bread paired with plantain chips- what a meal! The sandwich quickly disappeared. I ordered the pastries to go and now understand why they are sold in dozens. I ate mine so fast I almost gobbled down my fiances as well!

I went to Porto's bakery for the first time today for lunch because my coworker and I had some time to kill before the Conan show we were going to attend. Apparently vegetarians go nuts for this place, according to a yelp insight, but I definitely felt otherwise. Being a vegetarian my whole life, I'm always mentally prepared to find limited vegetarian options at restaurants. When I saw that they had 2 different Veggie sandwiches, I decided to go with the Veggie Porto's sandwich with more, for lack of a better word, meat in it. (See menu for ingredients) I have to say, I've never had a more bland tasting sandwich with grilled vegetables than the one I had here. The vegetables were grilled okay, but soaked in oil to the point where the bread just couldn't hold the sandwich and fell apart. There was no salt, no pepper, and no seasoning whatsoever. It was just raw grilled veggies that were not savory in the least. On the bright side, I enjoyed the tiramisu dessert which had the perfect amount of sweetness to over power the bitter taste I had from the sandwich.
