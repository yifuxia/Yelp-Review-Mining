Still much to try though. My favorites are the cheese rolls (duh!) and the guava and cheese pastries. Both are just musts if you're going for pastries. Another fave is the potato balls filled with ground beef...so killer! Great for party appetizers or just grab a couple for a snack. I also like their meat pastries, but I'd say the hubby isn't a fan. For cakes, we love their tres leches cake...the one with fresh berries. Can't beat the price too! Who would go to the grocery store to get a cake when for literally a few more $ you can get one from here? Often times we will stop to grab something for a party later, get some coffee (which is decent, and I'm picky!) and a pastry or a breakfast sandwich. I really enjoy their chorizo breakfast sandwich.

I over-ordered and got a 12-inch cheesecake (which I was told would feed 12 ppl, but instead feeds 20-25), and a 9-inch Parisian chocolate.When it came time to cake-cutting, we obviously knew we had more than enough cake for everyone, so people were eager to try both. \u00a0Chocolate cake went over well, but the cheesecake did not cut well at all. \u00a0It crumbled. \u00a0I'm not sure if it's because we cut it after it came out of the fridge 10 mins before -- maybe we should had let it thaw more or less? \u00a0So, we couldn't cut any pieces at all from this, and it turned out to be more of a cheesecake crumble than a cake when served. \u00a0Still tasted great. \u00a0Confused, I let it thaw a bit more when I got home, which didn't stop it from crumbling. \u00a0:( \u00a0What'd we do wrong?So, while their cakes taste amazing, we have more than half of a 12-inch cheesecake in our fridge, which doesn't look much like a cake at all. \u00a0I should have just ordered a 9-inch cake of both. \u00a0We probably would have come closer to finishing both -- if the cheesecake had just cut cleanly.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Cheryl V.", "time": "10/12/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "DROOOOL.

It was sweet and slightly tangy - a unique treat that I drool over the memory of.Also tried a mango mousse, but it wasn't so memorable. Next time I'll be brave and go with my gut instinct and try the dulce de leche cannoli. LOOKED RIDICULOUS. I was too intimidated to get on last time, but next time I will man up.If you have never had the good fortune of stumbling upon the a treasure chest that is a box of Porto's Bakery takeout pastries...
