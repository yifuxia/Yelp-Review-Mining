[{"content": "Porto's is a great great spot to come for lunch. They have everything anf anything you can think of. The food and pastries here never disappoint. The sandwiches are awesome here; simple and flavorful. I really like how they give banana / plantain chips with your sandwiches instead of the typical french fry. But if you're itching for something starchy, get the potato balls; they're are killer! They're pretty much bite size sheppard pies, but we warned! They may look small, but after eating 2, they'll fill you up and induce massive food coma.The line is always long, so don't get discouraged by it.

My friend got inca cola, 2 potato balls and 2 meat pies and our total was only $13,55! Really cheap in my opinion.My croissants were delicious; the ham and cheese was served with fried bananas and had mayo, lettuce and tomatoes; the other wasn't completely filled with chocolate but it had both sides dipped in sweet cocoa.I tried the potato pies (filled with meat) and didn't like it. But the meat pie was delicious.Parking lot is big but since the place is busy, look for parking on the street.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Natalia R.", "time": "5/16/2010"}, {"content": "Absolutely delicious. The mash potato balls and the meat strudels are the best. \u00a0MEAT PIESI can't decide which one is better, but I think I'm leaning towards the meat strudels because they are a tad bit lighter, so I can eat more of them in one sitting! \u00a0They pastry is so fluffy and just falls apart deliciously. The meat inside is well marinated and flavored. I love love the meat pies.POTATO BALLSThey are flavorful and mushy on the inside, bready on the outside. Perfect. We also had the tuna melt, the steak sandwiches, and of course, the addicting banana chips.

I tried the one in Glendale and now Burbank. I'm happy to say that I love this location the most. The inside lines were still as long as any other Porto's. However, parking was free and not a hassle! And this location is like a Starbucks...located on the corner of the street. Yes! Finally Starbucks couldn't get this corner! Ha! Jk!! What I ordered was the following:1. Raspberry kiss-The cookies was fresh and crunchy! The filling of raspberry jam was gushing out like a Gusher fruit snack. I know back in the days fruit snacks...lol!2. Potato balls-Finally I got the hot potato balls! Omg! Delicious! The outside was nice and crispy like eating a fried tempura when it comes out hot. The filling inside had enough flavor and spices. The meat was not overcooked and the vegetables inside tasted great. 3. Tiramisu-In a cute little cup, the topping tasted like Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal. The coffee cake inside was not good, it was a bit soggy...however eveything else was good. I would recommend going to Eat Cake Cafe.4. Fruit tart-Disappointed that I found out that the fruit tart with the chocolate tart; instead of, the pastry tart, was seasonal. This tasted like a fruit tart that you can get anywhere. The fruit toppings was made very fresh and I only liked that part. Service here was excellent! There is a front door greeter, she was very nice and friendly. Also, there are two lines, one for take-out and one for dining inside. The workers behind the counter was sweet and kind, very patient too.
