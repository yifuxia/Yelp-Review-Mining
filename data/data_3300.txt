Happened upon Porto's midday on Saturday and man the place was jumping. The energy was palpable, the lines long and the chaos in full swing.

I mean, people I know I like, people I don't know, they are just in the way...Anyway, after I go over my frustration with the crowd and settled into the line things moved quickly.

What makes Porto's so great? Why won't people stop f*^cking talking about Portos???I had two or three \"unsuccessful\" visits to Porto's. The long lines, the loud dining room, all things that worked my nerves and made me less than pleased when sandwich time finally rolled around. Additionally, it's hard for me to order at Porto's, because 97% of their sandwiches contain onions and bell pepper. Onions and bell pepper are Rachel Krypotonite. They're poisonous, stinky veggies which reduce me to a writhing ball of stomach acid and indigestion. Their presence in food is so dangerous to my insides that I do not consider them food, and I recoil in horror when they are presented to me. Well, I finally found a sandwich that's pretty tasty at Porto's, although \u00a0suspect they're relying on onions and bell pepper to create the flavors that they're so beloved for. That's to say, my sandwich was a little bland, but overall it was well-prepared. The plantain chips make me especially happy as well :-)The magic of Porto's, for me at least, is in that long bakery case of fascinating confections. I was told to order a cheese roll, and it was incredible, flakey and creamy and simply lovely. I also got to eat a third of a Neapolitan, and while it was a little messy, it was also divine. Porto's is a great place to go for a little indulgence, and you better believe I'll be back for a little nibble of everything in that bakery case!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Rachel B.", "time": "4/17/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "How Taking A Ride From A Stranger At LAX Led Me To Porto's:As a child, I remember my parents giving me the same rule of safety that every kid probably hears at least once in their lifetime - \"Don't take rides from strangers!\" \u00a0Its probably a sound rule of advice to take even as an adult, but for whatever reason on that day in LAX a few years ago, I decided to ignore common sense. \u00a0And what resulted was a free lift from the airport and my first trip to Porto's in Burbank.A few summers ago, I headed out to LA to visit friends who were living in Burbank. \u00a0The original plan was for them to pick me up at the airport, but the day before I flew out, they called and said they had received an invitation to go to Disney....and they chose the Mouse over me. \u00a0When I asked how I was supposed to get from the airport to their place in Burbank, they said, \"Its no problem. \u00a0There is a bus that will take you from LAX to Burbank for around $30.\"When my plane landed the next day, I retrieve my luggage and head to Ground Transportation in search of this \"Burbank Bus.\" \u00a0A concierge asked if I needed assistance, and after explaining to him what I was looking for, he told me that there was no such bus. \u00a0\"Okay, where can I grab a taxi?\" \u00a0He showed me the way, but said I'd be looking at around a $100 cab fare to get to Burbank. \u00a0I thanked him for his help, and decided that renting a car would be my best option. \u00a0So as I'm heading over to the rental counters, I hear a voice from behind me ask, \"Did you say you're trying to get to Burbank?\"I turn around and I see a petite middle aged woman standing there. \u00a0\"Yeah, my friends kind of gave me some bogus information on buses and I'm trying to get up to their place.\" \u00a0 She tells me that she's here to pick up her daughter from Atlanta, and that if I'm willing to wait for her flight to get in, she'd be happy to give me a ride to Burbank. \u00a0All of a sudden I flashback to that moment when my parents were telling me about taking rides from strangers, but I look at the woman, who seemed innocent enough, and figure I could take her if she tried to kidnap me! \u00a0(probably not the greatest reasoning for getting into a strangers car.) \u00a0But my instincts say that there is nothing dangerous about the situation, so I agree to take her up on her offer.We sat and exchanged small talk, telling each other about what kind of work we're in, family, etc. \u00a0When the daughter arrived and heard her mom announce that she was giving this random guy from the midwest a ride from the airport, the look on her face showed that she probably thought her mom was crazy for GIVING a ride to a stranger! \u00a0We head to their vehicle, and leave the airport.She gives me advice on side streets to take and which freeways to avoid (I think it was all of them....) \u00a0Then she asks if I'm hungry, and if I'd like to go grab some food. \u00a0 The mom and daughter had this tradition/routine of stopping for Cuban sandwiches on the way home from the airport. \u00a0Not wanting to interfere with that, I agree to go along for some food with them, and we arrive to a place called Porto's. \u00a0I order a Cuban sandwich with them, and have more conversation with them.The sandwich was delicious, and the atmosphere, although busy, was very comfortable. \u00a0Its a place that I wish existed back here in the midwest. \u00a0I now have family that live in SoCal, and every time go to visit, I always make a trip up to Burbank to visit that quaint corner bakery known as Porto's, and enjoy another sandwich or one of their desserts. \u00a0And its funny to think....had I not taken a ride with a stranger at LAX years ago, \u00a0I may have never discovered this great establishment!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Brandon F.", "time": "6/13/2012"}, {"content": "YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH THIS PLACE!!!!!
