Food this good should be a crime.On the first trip, I got the Cubana sandwich, 2 potato balls, a cheese roll, and a chicken croquette.Cubana- meaty and buttery goodness with alot of crumbs. I know eating while driving is bad, but I was in a hurry to SLO, and I ended up with crumbs all over myself. For less than $5, it's well worth it.Potato Balls- think ground beef gravy with mashed potatoes... fried into a ball! It's like a portable version of mashed potatoes and gravy. What else? It's something like $1!Cheese Roll- I had to come back on my second trip to buy a dozen. It's just like a cheese danish, but the amount of cheese versus flaky pastry was perfect.Chicken Croquette- the only thing I wasn't crazy over. I can't really remember what was inside other than chicken.On my second trip, I just bought 2 potato balls and a dozen cheese rolls. I regretted not buying a dozen potato balls the second I walked out the store.

I ordered their chicken sandwich, dulce de leche cookies, and an elephant ear. I short of vacuumed my meal. Everything was delicious and not at all expensive, I was surprised in fact.

All time favorites: Guava strudel, cheese rolls, and potato balls! I've tried many of their danishes and baked goods as well as their sandwiches. The cubano sandwich is my favorite and then the chicken fajita sandwich. Love the bread it comes with. The guava smoothie is very refreshing and addictive!The meat pies are so good as well as the spinach pie. I finally tried the pork tamales this past weekend and it was SO GOOD! Portion is big and I love the bits of corn in it!Ordered a custom sheet cake (cuban cake- guava and custard filling) for my Dad's 60th birthday. They did a great job with the decoration (looks exactly like the picture) and it tasted amazing. Big hit at his bday party for those who never had Porto's before. The fruit tart is good as well, however, I would like more custard in the tart than cake.
