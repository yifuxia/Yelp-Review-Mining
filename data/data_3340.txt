The parking lot seemed jammed so I found street parking across the street. When I stepped inside I couldn't believe how crowded it was. You have to wait in line to place your order and then they bring your food to your table (or you can take it to go). It was so crowded I almost left, but I decided to go ahead and order something to go. I took the crowd as a sign that the food would be good. They have the order process down to a science so it only took a few minutes to get through the line.I got the turkey croissant except I substituted the croissant for 7-grain bread. They make the bread fresh in their bakery. When I got my order, I was impressed that for $6.00 I had gotten not one, but two turkey sandwiches plus an iced tea. I thought that was a ridiculously good deal. The sandwich was turkey, lettuce, tomato, swiss, mustard and mayo and I asked for avocado. Something about having that freshly baked 7-grain bread made that sandwich super delicious. I ate the second sandwich later in the day for a second meal.
