I've been here a couple of times but went here in Monday afternoon around 2pm. Luckily it wasn't so busy so during the wait in line we had the chance to look over the pastries. The employees are very kind, even when it was a bit noisy she was able to get our order. I highly recommend the dolce leche kisses, which is a short bread shaped as a hershey kiss filled which dolce leche something compared to caramel. The mango turnovers are very delicious. We tried the coconut glaze but the outer shell was a bit difficult to bite into since I was something like a hard candy shell, but if you like coconut go for it, a bit sweet for my liking because of the candy shell. The guava cheese is very good. I tried the sandwiches such as the capressie (idk if I've spelled it correctly) but there was mozzarella cheese and tomato. It was okay. \u00a0Tried the shredded steak and with there was more toppings or sauce since it was kinda dry. The also have banana chips that come with a seasoned olive oil dressing( has herbs, lots of garlic and vinegar) which I thought wasn't going to taste good but was actually pretty good. I actually added the dressing to my sandwich and tasted even better. Overall \u00a0I like it here, usually come just for the pastries.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Jamierose B.", "time": "1/31/2015"}, {"content": "I came here armed with cash ready to load myself with delicious potato balls but ended up with a Red Velvet cupcake, a Fruit Tart and a Triple Chocolate Mousse as well! I couldn't resist =-)First things first: Since WHEN did Portos start stuffing their potato balls with chili? I haven't been here for about 2 years and I don't recall there EVER being meat in those balls (no pun intended). But don't get me wrong, I was DELIGHTFULLY surprised! They are SO good! In fact, I am craving them right now as we speak.Their Red Velvet cupcake is pretty good as well. Not as rich and decadent as Sprinkles, but hell of a lot cheaper! ($3.75 vs. $1.60). The frosting on the cupcake is just as delicious as Sprinkles though, in my opinion.The Triple Chocolate Mousse was way too rich and chocolate-y for me. I know some of you might be wondering, \"what's so bad about that?\", but it's just not my cup of tea. Other than that, it was really light and refreshing for a heavy chocolate dessert.Lastly, their fruit tart was the most expensive item that I bought, about $2.60 I believe. The tart itself was very buttery and flaky, and in my opinion, perfectly baked. Their custard however, wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it to be, but you can tell that Portos uses only the freshest and juiciest fruit for their tarts!Portos is absolutely delicious and insanely popular for a good reason. It is almost a guarantee that you will not find these chili filled potato balls anywhere else!

The main goal was to get cheese rolls, of course. The line was long when I got here but the workers got the line moving really fast. I also got an iced white mocha for the road which was really yummy. My boyfriend isn't a big fan of coffee so when he told me it was really good then it must mean its really good lol. They do have a private lot next to Porto's but it's really cramped so I suggest try finding parking in the front if you can. I wish I grabbed a real meal before leaving because as I was walking towards the bathroom, the food that the people ordered looked really yummy. So next time I come here before leaving SoCal, I'm definitely going to be grabbing lunch/dinner here than waiting till the next pit stop (Grapevine).", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Janice V.", "time": "4/20/2012"}, {"content": "Don't be intimidated by the long line. \u00a0It actually goes pretty quick. \u00a0The most I've ever waited here was about ten minutes.First off, you HAVE to try the chicken croquettes. \u00a0They are SOOOOOoooooOOOOOoooo...... tasty. \u00a0It's crunchy and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy, potato, chicken and cheese on the inside. \u00a0Although it's fried, it's not too oily \u00a0either.Otherwise, between the meat pies, potato balls and empanadas, you're definitely bound to find something to satisfy your taste. \u00a0You can also get one of their sandwiches. \u00a0My personal favorite is the Cubano sandwich. \u00a0The bread is crispy on the outside and the ham and cheese inside blends well with the mayo/relish sauce. \u00a0Also, if you opt in for the sandwich, remember that you get some fried plantains on the side. \u00a0These plantains are quickly fried and not soaking in grease, and gives you a crunchy texture with whichever sandwich you order.Also, their pastries are amazing. \u00a0Save room for a pastry if you're eating at Porto's because you won't be disappointed. \u00a0I usually get the guava pastry. \u00a0The croissant/phylo dough exterior with the sweet guava jam on the inside. \u00a0mmm..... it's heavenly!!! :)Lastly, you truly get a LOT of bang for the buck. \u00a0I had a Cubano sandwich, potato croquette, chicken croquette, meat pie, chorizo empanada and a quava pastry ALL for under $10. \u00a0Needless to say, I was STUFFED. \u00a0Come here for amazing food at an amazing price.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Howard H.", "time": "3/22/2012"}, {"content": "I bought two fruit tarts that were horrible.

I can see what all the fuss is about. I met my friend here around noon on a Sunday and the place was packed! Fortunately I was able to find parking. We were hungry so we decided to order from the deli. She and I both ordered the Steak Torta. She also got the potato ball things (sorry I forgot what they were called) and I also ordered a Raspberry Cheesecake. The meal was delicious! The steak was cooked just right and the Torta was lightly toasted to perfection. I really liked the banana chips that came with meal too! Not too sweet and slightly salted. In all, I was quite impressed. I wish I had had more time but had to get on the road back north. I wanted to grab something from the bakery SO BADLY! It's okay...

Pretty please?Back in the day I would travel to LA on business every now and then, and thanks to the recommendation of a friend, I found Porto's.

There's not a whole lot I can add to what others have said, so I will just say that this is by far one of my favorite places to visit. So much so that I may have packed some empty Tupperware in my suitcase just to be sure I'd have plenty of room to bring some delicious food back to Seattle with me.
