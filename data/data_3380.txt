Those are still stellar menu items. I think I've over indulged in cheese rolls that I can't seem to order them in every trip. As a result, I have been able to try other pastries. On my recent trip, I decided to order the steak torta instead of my usual hot pastrami sandwhich. I'm a picky sandwich eater. The type that doesn't like mayo, mustard etc... However, the steak torta did not need to be changed one bit. It is caterogrized under grilled sandwiches. So I was thinking a panini style sandwich. Porto's definition of a grilled sandwich is when a component of the sandwich is grilled. In this case, it was the steak. The steak was tasty. It was suprisingly tender and not chewy and tough like many other steak sandwiches. It was like a burritto in a bun with the gaucaomole, cojita cheese, black beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and steak. If you dine in, the sandwiches includes plantain chips. Unfortunately, there is no complementary serving of the chips when you order the sandwich to go. It's the same price, which I thought was fun. The chips are good. They're not sweet and not overly salted. The thickness is like a potato chips so it provides the same textural experience to complement your hearty sandwich. I can't end a trip to Porto's without the fruit tart.
