[{"content": "My first time to visit Porto's, after how many of my friends who have posted their visits & countless photos of their pastries they brought home.. I was determined to make that visit happen! Thankfully being that we stayed at Burbank for July 4th weekend, it was for Universal Studios. I looked through what was surrounding us in this beautiful city & Porto's caught my eye quick! Biggest orders I read were mainly their cheese rolls pastries & their potato balls. I had no idea what these would taste like?!! Biting into the cheese rolls, they taste like petite palmiers that we buy at Costco.. minus the yummy warm sweet cheese filling. Biting into the potato balls was definitely something else! I literally expected just potato flavor. Or mashed up potato inside. It was more then that! Ever had Shepard's pie??? Well, this was that, but fried on the outside to grip for taste U can love! Very satisfying to eat & U can eat this alone for in between meals when hungry. Shoot, I should of brought this w/me inside Universal park. It would of kept me full!! It's like a lunch treat! Your kids will definitely be full off one! I advise to reheat in a toaster oven to get the crispy texture this flavor deserves. I am all about texture and flavor so reheating it in the toaster oven is so worth it! We also bought this new pastry they made. It's called tres Leche kiss! Ooh maaah gaaaaah! It is out of this world yummy! I would compare it to the Mexican wedding cookie from Whole Foods. But the filling has the butterscotch for this at Porto's. It's so worth it for 1 dozen! I just wish that I ordered 2 dozen for the cheese rolls & the potato balls. And I didn't have time to try their sandwiches and I wish I was able to do so. Guess I really got to wait for next time we go back to Burbank again. This bakery is beautiful and spacious inside. It has a nice location that feels like your walking in your own town. Parking isn't too bad but can fill up quick! They have complimentary valet, which I saw was free. And they have to opposite ends for lines to order your food. They are very organized and they always keep all foods stocked up so that nothing ever gets run out. Well, least in my 1st experience coming in. It's pretty loud with lots of people talking/chatting. They have someone who keeps the lines flowing & guides you where you should line up at. I advise you to make sure you know what you want. Do your homework first! Being in line to order is overwhelming, because they have lots to choose from & you do NOT want to hold up the line. I didn't do much of HW to research their food, esp on Yelp, which I should of. But everything, \u00a0to their cakes looked amazing! They give samples of what is available for you to try and I \u00a0am happy they did, which made it so much easier to order!I will definitely come back once we are in town again!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Angel F.", "time": "7/6/2016"}, {"content": "Had \u00a0the Vege-tar ano \u00a0sandwich \u00a0which was delish.Sadly, \u00a0I didn't have a chance to eat something \u00a0from the bakery. \u00a0I \u00a0can't wait to come again.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Olivia M.", "time": "8/19/2016"}, {"content": "TIP FOR YOU: When ordering with your group of people, get your own server if you are paying separately because sadly, some of these fine lady servers get quite upset when you tell them that after the orders were taken.

Lines are to be expected. However, I think an hour wait is a bit excessive for Portos especially before 7am.I tried to call in my order but no one picked up the phone so just decided to drive there.That was not that big a deal, the Holidays are crazy and I get it so I can get over that.But here's what is not ok, I ordered 30 potato balls and 1/2 a dozen guava and cheese for my office. Easy!simple! Nope. Waited another 15minutes and here's what twisted the knife..when I got to the office and opened the box there was only 26 potato balls!? Wtf? They sure as hell charged me for 30 potato balls, but that's not what I got! In fact, just 5 months ago- according to one of the helpers here they were .78 cents each, well not today! They charged me .98 cents each! Quite the increase in 5 months! Do they go up in price because it's the holidays? I don't know but LAME.I'm sad I had this experience since it's usually always a nice experience but definitely NOT TODAY.Stay away for the holidays!! Trust me.

It was an experience. The line was extremely long but it moved quickly. The service was not friendly but it was fast. We were a bit confused on the process as it is not clearly explained and your just kinda shuttled through the lines (yes, plural, you have to wait in more than one depending on your order) it seems there would be more efficient ways to organize the process but what do I know. The place was packed so it must be working. We had an assortment of pastries and coffee. The coffee was good as were the pastries. I didn't have anything that seemed exceptional. I can't say that it was good enough to come back, maybe I'm spoiled with the goodness in available in Phoenix.

Ssrsly why do I even bother?BEST BAKERY in town....hands down. It wasn't the hype that got me into Portos. It's years and years of having tasted mysterious flaky potato balls, cheese rolls, pies, tarts, cakes....at random places, random parties with random people. My reaction has always been....\"OMG who brought these?!?!\" I NEVER had to physically go to Portos. Somewhere someone is serving their pastries at some random party.And EVERYBODY knows Portos. I started working in Burbank. Sure enough, our office meetings and parties are catered from Portos. It was then I was reminded that I'm dangerously in close vicinity. I just started visiting their physical location. There is NEVER a down time. The line is always long, from morning to night and seven days a week. Someone in line is always from another state who is visiting just to try their infamous baked goods. You can stretch your dollar here.....I bought pastries and cakes for 50 people under $140. I really should stop here. If you haven't tried Portos, shame on you.Plenty of parking in the back lot.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Sharr K.", "time": "5/5/2015"}, {"content": "This is the most amazing place!

I'm their phantom customer as I have never physically been to Porto's but I have had their potato meat balls plenty of times at parties. They are ALWAYS so delicious and perfectly crispy.

These would be a fantastic appetizer at a wedding! I feel like a princess because it is always magically in my presence. I'll make it to Porto's one day.Tips: To reheat the potato meat balls at home I recommend microwaving them for 30 seconds to give it a head start on the heating and then finishing it off in the toaster oven for 2 minutes to crisp it up.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Trisha W.", "time": "11/18/2015"}, {"content": "So, I've been to Portos numerous times. I've had their empanadas and potato croquettes a couple of times. Nothing to write home about in my opinion. Every time I've been here or the Glendale location, the line is off the hook. Tonight the line wasn't too bad. I needed to get some dessert for a dinner party I was attending. I decided cupcakes and cookies. After standing in line, one of the polite and pretty counter girls who all look the same with their makeup done and eyebrows perfectly arched and hair in a bun, called me to the counter of hundreds of pastries. \u00a0I ordered the chocolate Parisian, a red velvet, and a pumpkin cupcake. I also ordered three chocolate chip cookies. I also got two of my faves, Iron Beer (a Cuban drink treat). After dinner we shared the cupcakes. Lord have mercy! Those might have been the best cupcakes I ever had, ever. I've been to Sprinkles, Yummy cupcakes, Susie cakes, magnolia bakery, Crumbs, etc. nothing and I mean nothing compares to these cupcakes we had after dinner from Portos! The best thing about each pastry was the texture. Moist! Then the flavor, decadent, rich, flavorful and sweet. The cookies were perfectly baked. Moist and chewy on the inside, easy to break and a little crunch around the outsides. All desserts were sheer perfection. Honestly, even i was surprised. Im a hard nut to crack on desserts and sweet treats. Portos has made me a faithful crackhead who'll stand on line like everyone else regularly for a treat. The prices aren't too bad either.

Actually, pretty much everything they serve is reasonably priced. I can't even BEGIN with their pastries/bakery items. I haven't tried everything, but what I have tried, they're all so delicious. While Portos is known for their Guava pastries and strudels, they have such a vast selection of other delectable items, its worth trying 'em all out if you can.
