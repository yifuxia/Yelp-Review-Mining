The food is always consistently delicious, the prices more than fair, the staff hard working, yet kind and happy, and despite the crowds, it runs like a well-oiled machine. Food-wise, I haven't tried everything, but I always go back to the turkey and swiss croissant, which I dip in their mango vinaigrette. Also, the potato balls with a bit of mango dressing (while some may find this blasphemy) is incredible! I'm a big fan of the dressing, clearly; it's great with everything. Love the salads too, especially the steak salad... with mango dressing. And every time, I have to order dessert. Why not? It's $3-4 or less for a small portion, and it immediately brightens my day. My favorites are the tres leches cake, which tastes like melted ice cream in a good way, mango mousse, and tiramisu, but everything is always good. Oh, and a mango smoothie. Always. Porto's reminds me of those New York Italian bakeries where you just can't make a bad decision, no matter what you order (unless you're on a diet!).

It's always PACKED full of people and sometimes it's a little hard to move around BUT DON'T WORRY! Everyone is there for the same reason you are: to acquire some delicious food. Now I hear their sandwiches and drinks are good too and I see that they have an orange press to make fresh orange juice daily (it's always being used) but what I come here for is those Dulce De Leche cookies. Oh my goodness, they are out of this world. PLEASE TRY THEM if you don't know what I'm talking about. You can even ask for a sample from the server if you doubt how amazing these cookies are!Another favorite is their little potato balls filled with some sort of mixture of meat, peppers, and onions. A friend of mine told me about them and now I'm hooked. They're like little compact dinners. Very filling and tasty but they run out of them quickly so you can usually only get them during the day.The mousse, cakes, and everything here is just as good and I've never once complained about the quality of Porto's.

Can't wait until that huge breakthrough in the science world that makes dessert heathly and a must have diet! I hope Porto will have living-in \u00a0accommodation by then. (^_^)Driving from OC is definitely worth it. Can't wait for the one opening in Downey. Actual review of the food: all above this line is just writing from my pastry high.(@_@)Guava pastry, cheese pastry, mango mousse cake, cappuccino mousse cake, and chocolate croissant. Guava pastry Is out of this world good. I saw a food network show talked about the best guava pastry in Versailles cuban bakery Florida. Not sure when I can go to Miami, but im glad i found Porto's now. Hope I can compare the one day and do a review for them. Chocolate croissant is good but I still like SF Tartine's chocolate croissant the best. Maybe I should said I prefer the buttery crispy flaky outside and chewy fluffy inside, filled with lots of semi sweet dark chocolate. Porto's was more soft and buttery all over. The milk chocolate is too sweet for me. I love the sweet, but aroma comes first.Mousse cakes are silky and creamy. Essence of the mango dance in my mouth, aroma rush out of my nose. Happy taste buds.
