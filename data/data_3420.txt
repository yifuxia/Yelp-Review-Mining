[{"content": "Wow, this place is great! Too bad they don't have this in the Bay Area 'cause it would also do very well there.Desserts are phenomenal, especially stuff with Dulce de Leche. Amazing. And prices are really good.Sandwiches were solid. Nothing out of the ordinary. My wife had the Caprese one, which for some reason is only available at the Burbank one, while I had a pulled pork-type one, which was good, but didn't have much in the way of sauces. Prices were also quite good.This place runs like a machine--very efficient and relatively quickly unless you get a succession of clueless and slow customers that bog down the system. Two counters and multiple server/cashier people help speed the process along.Air conditioning is on full-blast and quickly makes you forget how warm it is outside.We're new to SoCal, but this is already one of our favorites.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Rob B.", "time": "8/2/2012"}, {"content": "Long lines, but quick service.

And it doesn't matter what you order at Porto's, it will be worth fighting those crowds!Seriously, I could probably retire off the amount of money this place makes in just one day. I have come here for late lunches at 3 in the afternoon and there are still long lines. But the they are full staffed with fast and capable people that keeps the lines moving fast. So even though there may be 20 people in line ahead of you, you won't be waiting in line long.And the food is awesome and very reasonably priced. I generally get the turkey croissant. Turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a delicious and freshly made croissant. It comes with yummy fried plantains all for only $4.15!! Go anywhere else in LA and you will pay twice that amount for a sandwich that isn't half as good.But in addition to great sandwiches at amazing prices, they also have incredible breads, cookies and pastries (this is a bakery afterall). There are some great munchie items as well including their famous potato balls and my favorite meat pies.If you haven't been here yet, you need to go check it out soon and tell them God Frank sent you.
