Yelp and a bunch of my friends had been suggesting this place to me for ages. But I never have a need for just a plain old bakery, so I never paid it any mind. They should really rename it on here as \"Bakery and Cafe\" or something.Anyway, today I was driving past the place and decided on a whim to go in. I'd been having cravings for cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for weeks and thought there might be some small chance that they had it. Sure enough, they had it. Not only did they have that, but the quantity of baked goods... I have never... there's... omg... I can't even give an estimate as to how many options for sweets were in the display case. And each looked more tempting than the next.But as I said, this is NOT just a bakery. They also have amazing Cuban food. Why did no one tell me that it wasn't just sweets?!?! I really wish I found this place sooner because I'd been craving some good Cuban food since I moved out here over a year ago. I had the steak dinner plate, and it was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked steak, delightful plantains (which I don't even normally care for), and tasty rice and black beans. It was enough to give me both lunch and dinner, and it was only $7something plus tax.And that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e really hit the spot, too. Quite yummy!This place really surprised me.

And get this, all the people who work here are nothing but friendly and helpful. Forget anything you hear about the line being long. It moves insanely fast! If you don't like the line go before 10:30am on the weekend, specifically on a Sunday and the line is half the size of what it normally is.If I had to complain about something it would be my own guilt after eating a sugary treat or feeling like I've committed a sin after eating too many tasty things.

I heard about the guava thing and cheese rolls so I decided to order that. I asked the person behind the counter what else he recommended, so he gave me sample of a pastry, not a small sample, but the whole thing..nice! =) I ordered some of that and I ordered a pulled-pork sandwich.

So why give it 4 stars you ask? \u00a0THE FOOD: \u00a0I had the egg and chorizo sandwich on croissant. \u00a0My hubby the laredo which was also yummy egg sandwich on croissant and had avocado. \u00a0My sister and brother in law both had the pan con lechon which I had several bites of. \u00a0The pulled pork was so moist and crispy at the same time and the french roll is sooo fresh. We also ordered the potato balls which were the size of golfballs and were basically fried mashed potato balls filled with a yummy savory ground beef mixture and fried to a golden brown....drool....Last, but not least, the cheese rolls. \u00a0Left to my own devices, I would probably consume 30 of these in one sitting. \u00a0I made sure to not be left alone with them, and only had 5 (shhh). \u00a0They are ridiculously addicting. \u00a0The flaky puff pastry, the sweet, creamy cheesy filling...drool...It left me wanting to try every pastry in the case. \u00a0This activity is now officially on the bucket list.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Kat H.", "time": "3/30/2012"}, {"content": "This place is delicioso!

Through my venue I was recommended Porto's Bakery, such a great place! My fiance & I made an appointment to go for a tasting and meeting with Karen B. The day of our appt we were running late & called last minute to reschedule. They were so nice and accomodating from the start, giving us a later appt time the same day, totally understanding. We got their early for our second appt as to make sure not to miss it this time. We decided to eat lunch there to just check the place out. Their por sandwich came highly recommeded so I had to try it of course. It literally melts in your mouth. I am craving one now as I write this :)We walked around Brand blvd to kill time, nothing special so we went back shortly and grabbed an iced mocha from their espresso bar. Again, amazing( and this is from a Starbucks superfan).Then our cake tasting appt began. Karen was sweet and pleasant from the start. She gave us lots of time alone to taste and make decisions. The8 or 9 cake flavors we were given we each mouth wateringly deicious in their own right. We went with red velvet w/ cream cheese filling & choc. w/ choc mousse filling. Karen was not pushy at all and willing to hear all of our ideas. As our meeting came to a close Karen made a point to say, \"If you choose to go with us here is our proposal...\" There was no question, we had nothing to think about and booked her right on the spot.We \u00a0had mentioed to her that we were having custom made cake toppers sent to us and were not sure of their dimensions to consider for the our top tier. Karen simply said to email her the dimensions and she would work it out. We emailed her later that week, she was quick with her response and let us know it would be work just fine.Later as our final payment was due I was told only cashiers check would work, the day she received it in the mail she emailed me to let me know. She must know how anxious we brides-to-be are. Then she even emailed me to let me know the day was cashed, apologizing for the delay. Such TERRIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.
