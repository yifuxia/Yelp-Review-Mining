I somehow had this image of Porto's as a small mom 'n pop shop so I was surprised when I walked in and saw bakery mecca. A huge space and endless rows of treats...this is the Superbowl of bakeries.I got in line and when it came to my turn, I walked up not knowing what to order. My eyes were starry from the selection. I told him it was my first time and he whipped out a meat pie for me to try. Charmed by his friendliness, I ordered:3 cheese rolls - great.2 meat pies - good, though I'm not a fan of minced meat.2 potato balls - great.2 chicken croquettes - just ok, \u00a0kinda mushy.2 red velvet cupcakes - GGYD, as in 'good God. you're delicious'.1 italian cheesecake - good.1 cream horn - looked good but I gave it to my friend as a treat.All this for $15. Pretty amazing, huh? Everything is so affordable it's practically free.I wasn't expecting to find a great cupcake here but it was SO GOOD. The frosting was super frothy - like whipped cream and cream cheese frosting combined - and not too sweet. Hats off to you cupcake, you can hang with the best of them \"designer\" bakeries.Is there any plan to open one on the Westside?
