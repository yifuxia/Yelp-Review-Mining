The parking lot is a claustrophobic nightmare.

I had a Cuban sandwich, a potato ball, a cheese roll and a fruit tart. All delicious.We were there right before the lunch rush so both lines we stood in (cafe for the sandwiches, bakery for our baked goods to-go) moved really quickly.

I was really excited to try this place out. The lines are long and the seating is a bit rough, but I have to say it was a great dining experience. The smell of the baked goods in line is intoxicating. The displays of cookies, cakes, etc is absolutely unreal. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the food they make. I ordered the pastrami which I've been missing since I came to Cali and an iced tea. The iced tea was so good with a little bit of splenda. The pastrami was small, but good. Back home they make pastrami sky high and I was a little dissapointed. Then again a pastrami back home can run $14!

The Porto's experience has ALWAYS been good. They are very organized, great customer service, Obviously everything is baked fresh daily; and I don't think there anything I've ever tried that I didn't like. I've been here for breakfast and lunch and to pick up the random fruit tart pies or holiday decorated cookies as I did today.

I did have a dream about this place last night, so I might as well review it. I had a dream that I ordered the cheese rolls and took it to go. I took it to this sketchy, dark parking lot... and it was so good!!!! I dropped it on the ground and got sad.I actually don't know why I had this craving considering I never actually eaten it. Anyway when I went here ... there's just so many people. I lined up and was confused for half the time I was waiting in line. I got a sandwich and an horchata! I got my sandwich but didn't get the horchata because I didn't know that I had to pick it up in a seperate line The sandwich itself wasn't memorable, but I like the banana chips that they give you for free. The horchata was too sweet, still good, but too sweet. I do wanna come back and try the cheese rolls, and maybe if they're as good as everyone and my dreams suggest, then I'll raise the rating to 5 stars.

No seats available, but I was just looking to \u00a0to-go. Waited in line for about 8-10 minutes until me and my gf finally got called to order. The guy was new but real friendly. He recommended a couple of baked goods to me but I already had my mind set on a few things already even though it was my first time. The Potato balls were AMAZING. They're like like packed balls of tacos inside. The cheese rolls were delicious, however consuming too many at a time caused me and my gf (who reaally wanted this and hadn't had one in years) to get sick of the taste after 3-4 in a short 10 minutes. They're an explosion of cheese in your mouth after a couple of seconds and very tasty but don't eat too many at once.. We also got a couple of other baked goods but nothing worth mentioning. We also got a horchata smoothie which had a really good ratio of cinnamon to milk. Surprisingly we can never find something with a good ratio but this was quite the treat. Overall, I give it a 4.

Well, I can't help it, at first I was a little shy about holding the fresh warm balls in my hand, but after taking a bite, I was pleasantly surprised.That's right - I love Porto's potato balls! What else would I have been referring to?Ever wonder what would happen if your elementary school's Sloppy Joe procreated with Mrs. Potato head? I did sometimes as a child, and now, the answer is clear - the offspring would be Porto's potato balls! 85 cents will get you these tasty balls filled with meat that are just awesome, after trying a couple, I wound up taking a half dozen home.Also on the menu (that we ordered) - Turkey Melt Croissant (okay), Cheese Roll (also just okay, very sweet), chicken croquette (good), and guava cheese rolls(yet to try). All of this (without the 6 potato balls) came out to $18 which is kind of pricey (the sandwich and the drink where the most expensive).The line was pretty long - but moved surprisingly fast. Waiting for the sandwich to come out though, took a bit of time. They do have two lines though - there's an express takeout line which moves really fast.

The place is pretty nice inside, but it was also loud. The pastries and lunch sandwiches were good but not anything outstanding. Not sure what the hype is all about.I had the Potato Ball Sandwich. The \"greeter style attendant\" at the front recommended the potato balls, and I was interested in indulging in something a little bit more substantial. I thought the sandwich would be the best of both worlds-- I could taste the crispy potato balls but also sample their freshly baked and crunchy bread. Unfortunately, the potato balls arrived luke warm and not up to the quality standards I was expecting with the huge croud inside. From what I can tell, this place used to be a great family-run bakery that cared about their local community. It seems like it has now been transformed into a commercialized bakery that cares mainly about profits.
