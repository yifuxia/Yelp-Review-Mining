I became a fan years ago when my family would bring home those delicious cheese rolls. When I was finally old enough to drive, I made my way to Porto's and discovered that they had more than my favorite cheese rolls.Potato Balls-meet and potatoes stuffed into an oversized (not teeny tiny meatball sized) ball is the perfect snack if you're feeling something salty.Guava Streudel-They have one with both guava and cheese in it but I prefer the plain guava. Why? Because it is fruit, flavorful and fantastic! I love it!Dulce de leche cookies-Soooo good! These cookies really do melt in your mouth.Torta de Pollo sandwich-I'm a lover of goat cheese and I love how they use it in this sandwich in place of mayo. This sandwich just tastes so fresh and the chicken is marinated with such a unique flavor. Any of their sandwiches come with fried plantain chips which I consider a big bonus!Ropa Vieja sandwich-I've had this sandwich in other place sand Porto's knows how to make this right! It is definitely far from being dry and has amazing flavor!Red Velvet Cupcake-I've tried this one and will pass on it in the future.
