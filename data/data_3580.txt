[{"content": "I really wish I could take Porto's Bakery back to Boston with me. It's just that good. My friend and I went twice over the course of our three day stay in LA, and each time we tried as many things as humanly possible. And we were able to do this because everything there was just so dang cheap! If it was possible, I'd say Porto's should have half a dollar sign on its Yelp page instead of a whole one.And each thing I tried was more delicious than the last. \u00a0I would highly recommend the following: the chicken croquettes, chicken empanadas, the potato balls (an absolute must try!), ham croquettes, the pork tamales (another absolute must), the Italian cheesecake (this was by far the best sweet item I had), and the raspberry cheesecake. \u00a0Their mango smoothie is absolutely delicious too. \u00a0And the best part is, \u00a0you could honestly try all of the above in one visit because it's so darn cheap.One thing you could probably skip is their sandwiches. \u00a0I got a feta sandwich and it honestly lay there forgotten in comparison to all the other treats.Depending on when you come, Porto's could be packed or empty. \u00a0The first time I visited was the middle of the day on a Saturday, so of course it was flooded with tourists. \u00a0Upon walking in, the first thing I saw was the massive line of people and it honestly looked like chaos. \u00a0But the employees seem to have their system down pretty well - the line went pretty fast. \u00a0And you're going to need that waiting time anyway - the menu is ridiculously extensive and everything looks so good that it is next to impossible to decide.The second time I visited, however, was a Monday morning, so the place was pretty quiet. \u00a0But honestly, I can hardly think of an instance where waiting in line has been more worth it. \u00a0So if your only option is to go on a Saturday, go anyway. \u00a0You'll be glad you did.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Andrea B.", "time": "11/16/2011"}, {"content": "Finally got to actually a) visiting the actual place and b) freaking out over what to order! Extensive, rich menu!Got the slow roasted pork sandwich (Pan Con Lechon). The pork was tasty, garlic spread + onions zested it up, fresh bread slices finished the job.

Every time I'm in the area it is a must!This place is always packed when I come, but surprisingly the waits aren't very long. They have a good system and the lines go surprisingly fast. There are 2 sides of the bakery: the dessert area and the deli/cafe area. All the desserts I have tried there (which is mostly all of them) are so delicious. You can't really go wrong with any selection, but my favorites are their creme brulee, cheese rolls, and strawberry cake. On the other side, I love their Cubano sandwich, chicken croquette, and of course, the potato balls. They are so mouth-watering and delicious. I can't describe the tastiness of them in words, you have to go to Porto's and try them yourself!

Porto's is known for their cakes, but look beyond them and you'll find a myriad of pastries, sandwiches and more. One of the best, and unassuming items are the cheese rolls. They look like some rejected item on a buffet table but you should really give them a chance. And a dozen for 7.98 ain't bad at all.

Let me count the ways..1. \u00a0Delicious desserts and pastries. Parisian cake, fruit tart, cheese rolls, croissants, brownies.2. \u00a0Very good food.

But somehow it isn't an issue at Porto's. \u00a0They are so well managed, have an abundance of friendly employees, and the lines move very fast. Don't let the crowds deter you.4. Last but not least, a word about their potato balls, one of the most popular things they sell. So good, so fresh, and so reasonably priced (under $1). \u00a0To this Jewish boy, raised on Brent's and Art's Deli, I know a meat and potato knish when I've had one. \u00a0And there's no better knish in the world than the cuban potato ball at Porto's.A good as it gets.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Steve R.", "time": "5/8/2010"}, {"content": "The place has amazing food, but it gets way to crazy and crowded.

Porto's is by far thee best bakery I've ever been to. All of their pastries are fresh, cultural, and absolutely delicious!

The Cheese Rolls are phenomenal and their sandwich specials are perfect; not too heavy, but enough to keep you satisfied. Basically if you've never been to Porto's Bakery before, no matter what you try is going to be delicious.

Went to Porto's for the first time today, and only just realized what I've been missing out on. The food and bakery items being amazing are a given, but I think the highlights for such a popular place are the service and the prices. Porto's could easily raise their prices and maintain a steady customer base, but they choose to keep it on the low end. The service was phenomenal as well - someone greeting everyone at the door, telling them where to go for what. I witnessed one particular gentleman (he seemed to be in a sort of floater-floor-supervisor-role) escort one customer with a cane to the front of the line. I appreciated that.The lines can be long, yes. But I honestly needed the time - after waiting in line for 15 minutes in front of the display case, I still had a hard time deciding what to get.
