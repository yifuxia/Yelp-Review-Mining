[{"content": "This place is AMAZING!! I went here for the second time today and I am blown away by the quality of food. \u00a0The first time I went there, I got the Pan Con Bistec, and it was delicious. \u00a0The steak was very tender and onions were very tasty. \u00a0Today, when I went, I got the Turkey Melt, and it was equally awesome. \u00a0The flavors they use in grilling their onions and in their meats really awakens the taste buds! \u00a0And I have not even mentioned the fresh sourdough bread!I have now bought a pound loaf of their sourdough bread twice there. \u00a0I am appalled at how the Los Angeles has never heard of sourdough bread before. \u00a0I can never find good sourdough bread anywhere (I am a NorCal bread snob). \u00a0However, Porto's somehow heard the secret on how to make good sourdough bread from NorCal. \u00a0Their sourdough has a hard, rustic crust, with a soft inside. \u00a0It has the perfect sponge consistency, with the ideal sour flavor. \u00a0One of the best sourdough breads I have ever had.I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some great food for great prices. \u00a0And don't leave without some fresh bread!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Greg S.", "time": "1/3/2013"}, {"content": "Wow.

It was really good. I had high expectations of this place from all the things I heard and at the same time it didn't let me down but didn't really exceed my expectations. Me and my girl tried different things on the menu and here's how it went. Potato ball: very good. Like a sloppy Joe wrapped in mashed potatoes and deep fried to perfect crunchiness. Bought another to go and somehow managed to stay crispy after a couple hours. I was impressed. Chicken croquette: my favorite of all the items we got. Perfect tenderness of the chicken with subtle but strong flavor. Had great texture on the inner soft pillowy potatoes and perfectly crunchy putter texture. Mouthgasmic indeed. Meat Pie: there's is where I took half a star off. The flavor was there but it was lacking in substance and content. the flaky factor was awesome but the filling was just absent. it was a tiny smidgen of a tablespoon inside the pie. very disappointed.Chicken Empanada: im guessing they have mastered their crust/dough since it has perfect flaky crust. but man did the filling disappoint again. at least this time there was enough except it was extremely dry. flavor was there just texture of the filling wasn't good. took off a half star for that. Cheese Roll: again the crust is flawless. great tasting pastry. i want moreCuban Sandwich: like any normal sandwich really. meat was very good but i enjoyed the bread very much. soft on the inside crunchy on the outside and the melted cheese was just on point. plantain chips were decent as well love the idea lacked in flavor a bit, just needed to be seasoned a bit better. All in all great first time experience i would definitely go back for the croquette and potato balls and bring home a million of them. great first meal to start of my SoCal adventure!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Carl T.", "time": "7/5/2012"}, {"content": "You know when you find a place to eat and the WHOLE menu looks good BUT the first time you ever tried the restaurant the dish or dishes you had the first time were SOOOOOOO good that you can't ever bring yourself to order anything else? \u00a0Yeah, this is the place!!!Meat Pies, Potato Balls and guava/cheese or just plain cheese pastries! \u00a0That's my order.....EVERY FREAKING TIME! \u00a0I tend to bring others along with me so they can order other things for me to try!! \u00a0ahahahahahaha.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Janelle L.", "time": "4/29/2010"}, {"content": "My gosh. I drove all the way from San Jose to try this place out with my family. It was definitely worth it. There was a long ass line coming out the door when we arrive, but don't be intimidated! Stay there. Stand your ground, you don't want to miss out. The line moves hella fast anyways, in 20 minutes we were ordering our pastries. Plus they gave out samples to customers waiting in line! I got a free kiss from one of the workers there(; a free raspberry kiss that is. The raspberry kiss was good, never tasted anything like it. Not to sweet but the butteryness was delicious. Inside Porto's I got more free samples. They're quite generous, I expected a sample to be a small portion of a cheeseroll, but they gave my mother and I one per person. We ordered the potato balls, cheese rolls, meat pie, chicken empanada, guava strudel, guava cheese strudel, almond danish, the cubano, pumpkin muffin,chocolate croissant, and a banana nut muffin. The potato balls were heavenly. Crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Heavenly, truly heavenly. A MUST try. I recommend buying at least two per person. \u00a0The meat pie, guava strudel, cheese rollls, guava cheese strudel, were all very good as well. The cubano had a unique flavor, and wasn't too salty. Quite the perfect tasting sandwich. We ordered plantain chips to-go for extra (they're free if you dine -in with a sandwich) which were tasty. Crunchy and well salted. The muffins were the best that I've ever tasted. I liked the pumpkin muffin more than the banana nut one though. Croissant and danish were good, even though we ate them a day later. My only complaint is the chicken empanada. The meat inside didn't taste like much, and was dry. The pastries here are delicious and very well priced. I WILL RETURN TO PORTO'S ONCE MORE. To try even more baked goods.
