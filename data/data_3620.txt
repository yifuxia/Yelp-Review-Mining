[{"content": "Carbs Worh the Weight @ Porto's Bakery- BurbankSome of you were raised to think of carbs as the devil (Anyone else forced to eat Chicken for breakfast? No? Oh.)

The food is always freshly made. From the Empanadas to the Bakery, everything is freshly made daily and tastes incredible. The only problem is that they have the Bakery separate from the Sandwiches and Juices. Which means you have to stand in two separate lines (long cause the food is so good) to get everything you want. Highly recommend it since everything you get is incredible! They are very clean and have seating inside and out.

We found a spot in their parking lot in less than five minutes which is amazing. And when we got inside the place, the line for baked goods was already snaking around the entire floor (there was a separate line for the cafe), but it moved quickly. A very lovely man named Leonel helped us with our order, which was a dozen each of their very popular cheese rolls, the guava-cheese strudels, and some mango empanadas, potato balls, their cappuccino(?) mousse and a red velvet cupcake. We also had their white chocolate mocha drink and a chai latte. Everything was delicious and priced right. Indeed, those cheese rolls are heaven-sent. My brother complained how hollow they are inside, but that's the charm of those Porto's cheese rolls, along with their flaky, creamy-sweet, melt-in-your-mouth perfection. When my brother left for San Francisco, he had forgotten to bring a whole box of Porto's goodies with him, so I had to ship it to him and his wife via Priority Mail.

You will not find a bakery with such a long list of food that is sooo good and affordable. Did I say affordable?? If you're a picky eater, you have A LOT to pick from, and you will find something. They make THE BEST cakes as far as flavor and design are concerned, as well as very nice customized cakes too. I would recommend you get the Cheese Rolls, if you don't, please have someone punch you, cause EVERYONE I've given them to when I go to parties/bbqs they want to cry or have an orgasm when they eat it and they wanna know all about it. Gotta have it. Yes, it's that good and addicting. Get a dozen. I would get the Potato Meatballs. My god, so good with some good spicy hot sauce. Get a dozen. Then, once you get these 2 favorites you can at least experiment from there. IF you like sandwiches I'd try the Pan con Bistec (Steak with tiny fries & tomato sandwich).So you can imagine that since the food is so good here, there is always a line.
