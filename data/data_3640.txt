[{"content": "The 1000+ people who've already become blood brothers with Porto's by way of their potato balls will lynch me for saying this: I thought this place was pretty forgettable during my prior 2 visits. \u00a0Potato ball who? \u00a0I never mind waiting in Depression-era lines for a delicacy that puts a place on the map, but c'mon. \u00a0There is no way that a mound of seasoned beef encrusted in mashed potatoes, rolled into a ball, and then subsequently fried to a golden crisp could do any wrong whatsoever. I just wished they'd fry them \"a la minute\" for those who would prefer to inhale a half dozen on the premises. \u00a0The ones I've gotten were a tad lukewarm sitting in the warmer drawer, and these ones on my prior visit were no different.But no bother. \u00a0Anything and everything (including the balls) I've gotten reheats remarkably well, and is about 10x more craveable the next day, and this also includes their artisan sourdough bread. \u00a0Seriously, I thought that fresh bread was supposed to turn bad in 24 hours, but no. Preservatives? Maybe. But whatever \"preservatives\" they may (or may not be using) in Porto's Sourdough Bread are about 10x smarter than other preservatives found in similar bread around town. \u00a03 days after buying my sourdough batard, I still found the inside exceptionally soft, spongy and with plenty of those nooks & crannies that must be specially created to sponge up mounds of the best unsalted butter that money could buy. \u00a0Seriously though. \u00a0I just ate more than half the loaf in one sitting. Bread on my left, butter knife on my right. \u00a0I just wish my couch weren't so far away from my toaster oven.Overall, their Cuban Sammich really isn't so. \u00a0It does the job, but definitely isn't worth going over the moon for. \u00a0However, this place is definitely worth a trip for the overall experience, as the people who work the counters will appear to radiate sunshine, flanked by tall sunlit windows that border Magnolia Blvd. \u00a0DO NOT LEAVE without: potato balls (REHEAT LATER AT HOME FOR BEST RESULTS), guava cheese strudels, cheese rolls. \u00a0Yes I know, everyone and their mother always says that, but I haven't said it yet, so there you go.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Holly W.", "time": "6/9/2011"}, {"content": "Cheese Rolls and the Creme Brulee are to die for! \u00a0We've driven from the OC just to get dessert and eat here! \u00a0It was worth the drive.Had one of their dinner plates and it was good. \u00a0Can't go wrong with Portos! \u00a0I'll keep mine short, everyone else seems to LOVE it!Can't wait for the Downey shop to open up!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Arlene M.", "time": "6/3/2010"}, {"content": "Amazing food wish i could give 5 stars but this review is for ordering whole cakes. \u00a0I wanted to order a cuban cake and went in days before i needed it. They wanted to charge me $5 to NOT put flowers on the cake. I would understand if they were pre made but they do it the day of and it would save them time to just not do the last step. They even let you choose what color the flowers are. So i had to scrap the icing off my self at home. Also they have a pumpkin cake that is sculpted into the shape of a pumpkin & pumpkin flavored cupcakes. I asked if i can order a custom pumpkin 8 in round cake and I was told I could not.

There is a parking lot behind the bakery but good luck finding parking. It's pretty tight and since it's Porto's, it can be full.

We ended up getting cheese rolls, some cookies (which he provided us with samples), a new blueberry strati cupcake, tres leche dessert, sandwiches and drinks.We didn't have to wait long for the sandwiches and drinks.

I think its because this one tastes cheesy.- Cubano ($4.95): A sandwich that would normally cost $8-$10 at other delis/bakerys for about half as much? WIN! This was very tasty. I wish I had the opportunity to try other sandwiches on their menu. - Guava/cheese strudel: Thought this much hyped up pasty was only meh. Granted, I didn't have this when it was fresh... so maybe it is better than I experienced.- Cafe con leche: Too much milk, not enough coffee. Tasted weak/watered down.
