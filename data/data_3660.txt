Porto's, you are AMAZING.One day of shopping for Halloween costumes, we passed this place which was overflowing with people, which caught our attention! \u00a0We noticed every other time we went by that the outside seats were packed with people happily eating sandwiches.We finally said enough is enough and went in.**AMAZING**#1 - Long lines, but it moves fast. \u00a0There is a ton of staff behind the counter helping you.#2 - While you wait, you can look over their LONG menu of impressive sandwiches, as well as check out their display case filled with breads and pastries. \u00a0It's a very impressive collection, which you can clearly see from the photos.#3 - Every time we've gone, the staff member has been incredibly patient with us, despite the crazy line behind us.#4 - CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! \u00a0Sandwiches average $4!#5 - DELICIOUS!I've eaten their feta sandwich twice now, and recently tried their guacamole omelet sandwich. \u00a0Their eggs were surprisingly cooked to perfection! \u00a0I say surprisingly because some places have trouble with eggs. \u00a0:) \u00a0My only \"problem\" with the omelet sandwich was it is a LOT of egg, I was stuffed after half of the sandwich. \u00a0The croissant it was on was the perfect combination of flaky and soft.People I've gone with have had the Pork sandwich as well as the tuna melt, both give thumbs up.The potato balls were also a fan favorite, as well as the guava and cheese pastry. \u00a0That thing is incredible. \u00a0Guava is so under used in this country, and Porto's took control!!! \u00a0I could eat 5 of them in a row.Another thing they offer that we didn't have was cakes. \u00a0Their cake menu is as long as their sandwich menu, and also reasonably priced. \u00a0A full cake is about $20.Also, there is a parking lot in the back, as well as plenty of local street parking once you turn off Magnolia.Seriously, get in here now.... \u00a0I don't know how that Quizno's across the street has stayed in business!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jess R.", "time": "11/18/2009"}, {"content": "Don't get me wrong Portos bakery were really great. The service though are becoming very lax and staff are not paying attention carefully. \u00a0I had a terrible experience last Nov 29, 2014. The staff took my order of 6 dozens of cheese rolls, 1 dozen empanada, 6 pcs chicken croquette, 6 pcs banana plantain, 1 dozen potato ball, 1 walnut bread and some more other pastries. I was told it would take 10 minutes before they could get the cheese rolls then she came back to me says another 15 minutes. The 15 minutes passed and again nothing of cheese rolls. I ask for one of the manager and I was told again by the manager it would take 20 minutes. When 25 minutes came up no cheese rolls. I was again talking and complaining about their promises not being kept. While Im reiterating rhe dilemma Imbhaving with them and the frustrations about the services, another staff \u00a0would not finish me these dilemma having their services and promises not being delivered. I was always being cut off by the staff even though I told her shes cutting me off, instead of listening to my whole story as if Im the one creating the problem rather than Im the one having problem with their 3 different times of promises thats NOT being met. Elvia the original staff who helps me even have the guts to say \" I should have PATIENCE.\" But the more irritating one was: A friend of mine went to the other line and he got the cheese rolls from the staff name Alexander before I got the one I ordered 55 minutes earlier than my friend did. When I got home in the Bay Area I \u00a0check all the bags and there was no walnut bread that I ordered. Although, they didnt charge me for the Walnut bread but the \u00a0fact Im anticipating I had it to serve it for dinner that night was no where to be found. I would give the quality of pastries 4 star but SERVICES and ATTITUDE of some of the STAFF as ZERO. I hope Portos management would look into these problem.
