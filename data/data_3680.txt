I've been coming here for so long whenever I crave for some serious yummy pastries. Now that they have a branch in Burbank which works perfectly because my work is only 2 blocks away.

Let me give you some tips, if you order them hot like out of the oven, it's 10 cents more so get the room temperature. I have tons of favorites here. Line is short if you come around the afternoon, just after lunch time or two hours before they close.

It was a porktastic orgy of roasted shredded pork, ham, and even ham croquettes (on the media noche preparada). They both were delicious, but I think the Cubano won out for me because the mustard was more pronounced. You also must try at least one pastry.

So fresh and tasted like it consists of only mangos and nothing else. Too bad that I didn't get to try their sandwiches. Until next time!

Cheese rolls baby, soft flaky, buttery sugary, but not too sweet goodness with some cream cheese filling lightly baked to perfection.... Heaven in a croissant-like pocket. Grilled chicken sandwich is mighty fine also, but not extremely special if you are a sandwich sophisto. Ask for the garlic mojo sauce to slather on the side. (Basically, olive oil with soft cooked garlic and parsley with some light seasoning). NUMMY. Chicken empanada was good, but not incredible, however the meat was tender and had some nice flavor with the chiles and carrots inside. Pina colada cake, like a soft pina colada mousse, and not too sweet. Mango mousse was the fave with the fam. Tasted like a mousse like mango if that makes sense. Cream cheese and strawberry croissant was good, but the chocolate one was average to me. I also broke down and got a blended mocha, and that was just average, but it looked so pretty! I wish this was closer to the center of LA but alas, that is not so. Maybe for good reasons because I would be here every trip to LA if I could....
