C O N F U S I N G !- T O O M A N Y P E O P L E - I have given this place 3 chances..I dont understand the concept of standing in line to order your food then having to not only in a split second decide what to order , what sides and what to drink, and if you want something sweet..its another line! The food is okay..not great I have tried 3 things all were fine. Face it, pulled pork is pulled pork...The saving grace is the bakery, if I have a party I will buy a fancy cake here @ very resonable prices. Be warned that Cuban Sweets dont taste the same as American and sometimes it can look beautiful but taste like crap! Seating is far from intimate and there is no reason to \"hang out\".

I order a Cuban sandwich and the bread was authentic Cuban bread it's was airy and moist the mustard was good and I am not a fan of mustard they served the sandwich with mariquitas (fried Cuban plantains) and I felt I was back in the East Coast. My mom ordered black bean soup and I ended eating half of it. I was so full I was able to try any pastries but they looked delightful though. My friend told me about this caf\u00e9 and I thought it was little hole in the wall but I was so wrong it was really elegant of a place.

I just don't get it. \"To die for\" Nope not for this guy. Good yes, but not great. Beautiful place but I think \u00a0a lot of people are really missing the point. The quality of the pastry, which is what this place was built on. I had Red Velvet and Strawberry cupcake (taste only) and cheese roll. Good, enjoyed it-don't think I'd fight that crazy parking lot again - unless it was half empty for another one. \u00a0I found the cake aspect to be very cold, sort a like it was made-frozen and thawed on demand-iced and placed in the cooler. If you pay attention, you'll see that many of the items use same dough base. I trained in Italy with pastriesand I see were this place plays off that sort a Euro style bakery-panni-coffee vibe shop.Oh well, just my opinon.
