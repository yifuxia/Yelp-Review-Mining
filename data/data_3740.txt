Potato Puff - It was good, still warm when served. Chicken Croquette - I like this better than the potato puff. Cuban Steak Sandwich - I really like the texture and the taste of the steak. The bread crust was crunchy and soft inside. Tortilla Soup - \u00a0A little too cheesy for me, and there is no chicken in the soup (I prefer some meat in my tortilla soup) Roast Pork Dinner Plate - The pork was tender and juicy. Bean was just right. Plantain was not tasty though.Orange Juice - Yah.. Just like how it is suppose to taste. Bought a lot of pastry - yet to try them :) For the price it was very good.

Ok so my cousin just introduced me to this gem of place.She took me on Thursday and Saturday I had to go back for another sandwich and bring my hubby along this time. He's not into the crowds so told me next time he needs like 4 xanax to go ahahahhaYes it's a bit of a mad house in there but so worth it. Everyone and their mother wants something from Portos. The 1st I got the veggie sammy on french bread instead of the wheat it comes with, a guava pastry, flan, & a napoleon. I know everyone seems to love the guava but I wasn't a fan, sorry just not my thing.. but my husband loved it! BEST FLAN EVER!!!! Oh my I want more and more. hahahahah Flan is defiantly a hit or miss i've seemed to find out.. And this place takes he crown I have to say. When I told my friend what i had in the bag his eyes lit up when I said flan so that made me super happy. Veg sammy was amazeballs.. So Good! I also brought home a turkey melt for my hub, he enjoyed it very much.The second time I went back, this time with the husband.. I got the same sandwich but this time on focaccia bread... i liked the french better.. Hub got the tuna melt and loved it.. Could have been a lil thicker but the flavors were pretty dang great.. I didn't try it bc I don't like cheese on tuna not thanks... We didn't get any pastries that time just bc I needed to get him out of there and not have him sand on another line.. At least thats what I tell myself when I just didn't want to order a million things and have my thighs hate me the next day.. Stupid thunder thighs hahahahha \u00a0 I wish they would make the potato balls with some peas or something else besides meat, i was so excited when I saw them in the case then super bummed when found out they had meat in them!!! grrrrrr The cakes they have look fantastic and aren't super pricy either.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Carla S.", "time": "6/4/2013"}, {"content": "Porto's is a must hit for anyone a fan of Bakeries.

Visiting Porto's is one of those times. There are SO MANY options! It overwhelms me and makes me want one of everything. There are endless cases of pastries - savory and sweet, warm and cold.

The day I went, I was in a savory mood so I got a cubano sandwich, spinach feta croissant, chicken empanada, meat pie, and potato balls. The sandwich was good; it came with plantain chips. The spinach feta croissant was exactly what I expected; flaky, salty, spinach-y, and yummy. The chicken empanada was not my favorite; it had raisins in it which was not what I was expecting or wanting in my chicken empanada. Now, the potato balls...that's where it's at! Think of mashed potatoes formed into balls and filled with a meat mixture, then breaded and deep fried. I could have probably eaten a dozen of those little babies! I did also get a chance to try their tiramisu. It was not too sweet and had these tiny balls of crunchy cookie like things in them.
