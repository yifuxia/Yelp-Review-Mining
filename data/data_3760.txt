However, I ordered a 1/4 sheet chocolate raspberry cake with picture and decoration for my daughters' birthday. When I went to pick up the cake, they told me that cake was not ready because the date \"to be picked up\" was not until in 2 days. \u00a0Somehow, the person who took the order input the wrong date in the system. Anyway, they offered to make the cake in one hour and asked me to wait. I couldn't wait there and waste an hour so I just came back home and went to pick it up in an hour. \u00a0Cake looked the way I ordered it so I brought it home. After few hours later, I took the cake out from refrigerator to cut the cake and \u00a0realized that it wasn't the cake I ordered. It was chocolate mousse cake instead of chocolate rasberry cake. What made it worse was because of heavy mousse, cake was wobbly and I couldn't even put it back to store the leftovers. \u00a0I called the Portos Burbank next day and talk to employee in detail about the cake. She said that she will report it to a manager and I should receive a call shortly. It's been 3 days and I still haven't heard from the store. I'm very disappointed in the way they are handling the customers. At least someone should call me back and apologize for the mistake they made.

Yup, you read that right, only $25. \u00a0Now that my order was in, i was instructed to pick them up on New Years Eve at around 2:30pm. \u00a0I didnt understand why i had to be there at that time but once I arrived i found out. \u00a0The line was out the door and just as i stepped into it, I asked an employee if that was the line for pick up orders. \u00a0She said No and told me where to go. \u00a0I followed her instructions and checked in with someone at a computer who then told me to wait until i heard my name called and then they would give me my order and i would be on my way. \u00a0After waiting for about 5 minutes, they called my name and I was out of there. \u00a0Thank God i didnt have to wait in that line that stretched around the building and outside the doors.Once i arrived at the party, the Porto's was popped in the oven and came out piping hot. \u00a0Everyone there could not get enough of it and before you knew it there was no more. \u00a0Next time i will double the order and trade the chicken empanadas for the beef pattie/filo dough things. \u00a0Those are the bomb.Moral of the story: Call your order in 24 hours in advance, save some money and some time.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jose A.", "time": "1/9/2012"}, {"content": "Been to the Glendale location and went to this one last week pre-Ellen Show. \u00a0The line was much shorter and the cashier I was \"assigned\" to was so noticeably cheery and friendly; that was really nice :)I ordered a Pastrami Sandwich (as usual), 1 potato ball, and a Caffe Latte over ice. \u00a0Everything was very good - love the toasted bread - crisp outside, soft inside and they were not stingy with the juicy, flavorful pastrami, either. \u00a0The caffe latte was creamy and unsweetened, which I prefer, since I add my own.

The eggplant and cheese alone have so many flavors and put together with the rest of the vegetables and bread... omg best veggie sandwich, hands down. The top crowd pleasers on the menu had to be the potato balls and the cheese rolls. The potato balls consist of seasoned meat in the middle and wrapped around with fluffy mashed potatoes and a crispy surface. The cheese rolls resembled a cheese Danish: A crispy, flaky, fresh outer texture and a mouth-watering filling... definitely worth it. I thought that the cheese/guava roll had a unique, vibrant taste as well.
