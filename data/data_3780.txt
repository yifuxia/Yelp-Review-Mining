Even though it was 10 in the morning, the cake was absolutely delicious. Their sandwiches are really good too and come with plantain chips!

The only thing about Porto's is that I wish there was more meat. The meat was really tasty and I wish I had more of it. In the potato balls and chicken croquettes, there was much more potato than there was meat. The chorizo pie made me the most happy I think, but again, I wish their was a little less dough and a little more of the good stuff!I learned after I left LA that the sandwiches here are bomb too!

This place was almost like Heaven on Earth for me... I LOVE desserts!!!!!!!! I know there's not much more I can say that the other 1,488 reviewers haven't said... but this place is VERY reasonably priced with their sandwiches that come with plantain chips for $4.50-$6.50 (Cubano is the best in my opinion), their potato balls that every one goes crazy over are 90 cents, their meat pies which are kinda like pate chaud are $1.50 I believe but is only mediocre tasting to me, and their cheese bread which is like a cheese croissant pastry is SO amazingly good is a couple of bucks too...

Perfect size to have just1 or 2, then you're satisfied. \u00a0They're warm and filled with beef, good flavor, and potato. Even though they're deep fried, they're not greasy at all. I also tried the chicken sandwhich. The slices of chicken inside the sandwhich were thin and tasted great. The chicken wasn't dry either - I'm picky about that! The bread is always made fresh.The desserts are endless!!! Unique flavors and choices to choose from. The cheesecake was super good. It was light and fluffy, and big enough to share with another person. I also ordered a vanilla latte. It was just ok, nothing special. The prices are super reasonable too!
