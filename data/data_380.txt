[{"content": "Everything is GREAT (except the parking and the long lines) We have been Porto customers for at least 20 years now and we love everything they make. Only complaint is you have to time your visit just right or you'll be waiting for hours to order. The staff is usually good ( I've had some employees that are rude) but for the most part its a great bakery. If you have company in town you definitely need to take them here for a amazing cuban sandwich and a great cup of coffee, followed by their delicious cheese pastries", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Mary M.", "time": "9/5/2016"}, {"content": "This is definitely not my first time here and won't be the last. Wow! So many to choose from, they have such a wide selection of cake flavors, desserts, snacks, decorated cakes, party platters, and savory treats. Porto's is perfect for catering and parties, their food will not disappoint. My favorites are the meat pies, ham & chicken croquettes, and their strawberry shortcake! Today I ordered $400 worth of goodies for my cousin's baptism, and our server Valerie was so nice, friendly, attentive and patient with our huge order. She explained everything that we needed to know, and kept calm and a smile on her face the whole time. She even let me call my cousin & ask to confirm what she needed. I also picked up some goodies for today during my visit ^~^ Expect me here next time I'm throwing a party or having a pastry craving :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Suzy X.", "time": "6/7/2016"}, {"content": "I love this place and the manager Bobby is Amazing and very kind.

It is indeed worth four stars. When I came here I was amazed at how enormous their facility was and the amount of people they employ, it's literally a factory with a giant dining room packed with people. I didn't have time or the stomach capacity to try it all but I did have the pleasure of trying the ham croquettes, chorizo and egg omelette sandwich, and the potato balls. All of them were awesome and I can only imagine how good all of the other bakery items must be.

Every Filipino I know goes to Porto's when they go SoCal so I thought this was a Filipino bakery! Meat pies and potato balls so good!

Parking is convenient. There's a parking lot and street parkings. There's two lines. One on the left when you walk in is for the breads that are popular but fewer selections and the left is more selections with the usual popular breads. My parents and I bought 3 box full of bread. Pretty cheap considering how much we bought. Potato balls were bomb and so was the mango + cream cheese bread. Nom nom nom!!!! The lines get crazy long so be there early. I got there around 8:30am and the line was pretty long.

Came here today as recommended by a friend of mine while visiting LA and also by our hotel host. This place is a gem! We had to order quickly so I got the meat pie, potato balls, chocolate muffin, lemon cake, horchata smoothie and green tea smoothie. The horchata smoothie is such a delightful treat! Amazing out of this world taste. Everything we got was so good. The chocolate muffin was such perfection with its soft texture and not too sweet chocolate chips. Just melts in your mouth! I loved the meat pie also just as what I saw from other reviews. I will definitely come here again when I'm in town to try other varieties.

Now it has grown into the glorious Porto's with valet parking (downey) and parking structures that we know now. \u00a0Whether it be the mangos imported from France to be better equipped for making the perfect smoothie or filling plantains with black beans, the emphasis in quality brought by this bakery for the price is unmatched in every way.There is no surprise that this location has lines out of the door everyday at almost every time of the day, but the most impressive feature is how they handle the massive demand.Lines flow quickly so don't be discouraged.Those taking orders will memorize your order and in the 15+ years that I have gone to any of Porto's locations I have yet to have any problem.I recommend them whole heartedly to any and all of my friends.Favorites:Ropa ViejaPan Con BistecPotato BallsChocolate Croissants Any of their coffee (cortadito)Mango Smoothies", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Keith F.", "time": "1/18/2016"}, {"content": "I have always loved their bakery; however I tried their food for the first time last night and I came down with food poisoning.

Atmosphere: HUGE, moves fast. The menu is extensive so to save time look before you go.Food: Steak torta with plaintain chips. Under $10. Completely filling, and delicious. I'm a sucker for soft bread, black beans, and avocado. The steak was tender and not difficult to chew, and it was well-seasoned. The plantain chips are something else. Very crispy, light, thin and delicious.Also had to try the potato balls, which are heaven. It's warm, mashed potatoes and ground meat on the inside full of flavor, encased in a fried outer dough. Like, it doesn't get any better than that though, right?Everything is cheap, wait time is not long, service is friendly, and food is amazing. Also, their pastries are to die for as well.
