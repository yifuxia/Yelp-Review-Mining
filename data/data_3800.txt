[{"content": "Third update: Cheese rolls are a staple food (like rice to Chinese food) at Porto's. Bought a birthday cake here. A bit pricey but man was it good! The chocolate, the cream, the moist cake... wonderful. I love all the pastries. I totally find the little raspberry \"kisses\" ADORABLE and perfectly sized. \u00a0The potato balls and the guava cheese rolls are overhyped (tasty? yes. Mind-blowing? not necessarily), but I still LOVE this cafe. Must try lunch here some time. I say 4.5 stars.

I wish that they would offer a meatless version for those of us who are vegetarian or pescetarian. The Veggie Sandwich (with eggplant, zucchini & cheese on wheat bread) that they offer as a vegetarian option is my least favorite. I would prefer if they offered a Caprese (Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil) & Portobello Mushrooms & Cheese Sandwiches. They should also have cannolis.
