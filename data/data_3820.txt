When I first moved to NoHo I seriously stopped here about every other week. \u00a0Everything I have tried on the menu has been good and of course I fell in love with the potato balls when someone suggested them to me.Their sandwiches are also delicious and come with these tasty banana chips. \u00a0The only thing I'm not a fan of are their smoothies, I've tried a few different ones and they were all watery.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Kimber D.", "time": "8/11/2011"}, {"content": "Porto's is one huge, awesome bakery, that'll fulfill your sweet and savory cravings! I tried the potato balls (soft mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef, fried to a golden brown...make sure you grab those tapatio sauce packets to eat with these!!), guava cheese roll (excellent and unique, especially if you're a guava fan!), the infamous cheese roll, fruit tart (loved that it was made with a chocolate shell), and the pan con lechon (roasted pork sandwich...wish it had veggies or something in addition to the pork to balance it out). All of this was for about $10 bucks...maybe even less! Don't be turned off by the long lines, they run their business efficiently so it moves super quick. I can't wait to go back for more goodies and to try as many as I can.

Forget Corner Bakery or Panera. This place is much better! Better selection and better quality. Lines might be long but they are worth the wait. Good for grabbing breakfast and coffee. And, also good to grab a sandwich during lunch. \u00a0When I usually go here its to bring food to work for the breakfast club. When I do my co-workers are enthused! They look forward to me bringing breakfast to work. I usually bring guava & cheese pastries and an assort of other pastries. Porto's is a huge hit among my colleagues. Forget getting bagels from Noahs cause that gets old.Pork tamales are different compared to Mexican tamales but still good! Potato balls are off the hook! The meat inside is flavorful. Ham and Cheese Croissant is the best I ever had. Breakfast sandwiches are good and plentiful. Tips:Get a dozen of the guava & cheese pastries and a dozen of the Potato balls. Share them with your friends, family, or co-workers.Park on the street or there's a parking lot in the back.

I ordered a Porto's cake (round-chocolate) for my boss's recent marriage celebration and it was a cake for 12-15 people, which only cost $21 or was it $23. But still, the quality of the cake is beautifully designed and ridiculously delicious!The lines in this place is like being in Disneyland, except there are no fast pass - just your patience and your appetite.

I know it's kind of blasphemous to feel anything other than blind, unfaltering love towards Porto's, but when it comes down to it.... I dunno.The food is swell. The baked goods are boss. The service is on the stick. So why was I looking to agigate the gravel after eating? Well, the place is Antsville. I can't keep that up, so here we go. I'm not big on waiting a long time to eat a quick lunch. I'm equally unenthused when told I can't get a table without a number. I understand why they have these rules/issues, but that doesn't mean I'm ok with a 3 hour sandwich experience. Would I go back? Probably. Like I said, the place is good. Am I in a hurry? Nope, not in the slightest. in reality, it's a bakery. There's lots of bakeries. Some fail and some turn into hot spots. This one somehow made it to the latter side of success.
