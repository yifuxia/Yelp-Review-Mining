The potato balls are unique. I like the filling a lot but if you let them sit for a little, the grease will start to ooze out. Pastries aren't anything out of the ordinary.

I want to go to there!!!!Why did I just recently find this place? It is magnificent!! The food is just ridiculously good.FOOD: I had the standard Cuban sandwich because I didn't know what I was getting into, and I was impressed. Any sandwich that I can just pour hot sauce on is just delightful. It was a big sandwich so I had half to bring home and enjoy later.The chicken croquettes are delicious too. Of course, drenched in hot sauce :)Their coffee is great too. I had my standard black iced coffee and was pleasantly surprised that it tastes like coffee instead of watered down folgers.ATMOSPHERE: Super busy, but everyone is incredibly friendly. They really keep the line moving so don't be discouraged if the line looks ridiculously long. There is ample seating and they have a nice open layout.NEXT TIME: I must try their pastries.

I don't live anywhere near here but would make the trip if it meant spending the afternoon here.

Best plan is to try to hit this place on off times! The seating area is big, but crowded. Usually when the place fills up there is a staff member making sure that only people that have ordered get seated, since the wait staff bring you your food, this is helpful. There is a drink fountain in the seating area so you do not have to fight with the machine up front. Parking is also tight, the lot is big but when they are busy its almost impossible to park. There is no street parking nearby, except on Magnolia, so take caution when parking.The Media Noche sandwich is amazing! Comes with plantain chips on the side. For breakfast their omelet sandwich is great, but very filling! I prefer the spinach danish for my usual breakfast. Pastry's are good. Cakes look amazing!
