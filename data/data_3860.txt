This was next day mind you at home. And it was nothing short of amazing. The potato ball was mashed potatoes enveloping meat and then covered with some sort of bread crumb and fried. Heated them up in the oven and I almost wet myself they were soo good. I am sitting on my lunch break now eating one of the shredded beef tamales. And again, reheated, it is amazing. The meat pie was great as well. The meat was tender and the pastry was flaky with a touch of sweetness. These were all purchased a few days ago. So I can only imagine what it tastes like fresh.

No joke, parking can suck. But lucky for us, a car was leaving after we rounded the block a couple times.As we entered the huge, brightly-lit clean bakery, we realized that their cafe menu didn't include the pastries, breads, and famous balls, because they rotate their baked goods daily.If you just want something off their cafe menu, there's a separate line to the right (for the sake of efficiency), but honestly- the left part of the store is where it's really at. SO. MUCH. BREAD.The (left) line was long, and I was pretty lost on how the bread-picking thing worked, but basically: when the next available behind-the-counter \u00a0worker is free, they call you up, and follow you around as you pace back and forth along the display of sweets galore, choosing the goods you want.Despite how busy it was, the girl who was helping me out didn't rush at all. She told me her favorites were the mango mousse, chocolate croissant, and some cheese pastry, and gave me free samples to try. (emphasize: free samples).I ended up choosing 4 (they're priced per piece): the strawberry-cream cheese danish, sally cake, chocolate croissant, and mango mousse, and it came out to less than $10. \u00a0 Dude. When I opened up the box, the aroma that filled the air was. \u00a0 \u00a0freaking. amazing. Oh my world.Oh my world.The mango mousse was my favorite, but the danish was pretty bomb. ...And that's coming from someone who isn't too big on cheese.Ah, dude. Give me a moment to revel in how freaking good it was.Dang.Okay, enough reveling.The sally cake is huge. and definitely more of a breakfast-bread. It was a bit sweet, but paired well with black coffee.I was saving the chocolate croissant, but I checked my fridge this morning and it was gone.
