I got all the recommended items from yelp: empanada, guava strudel, and cheese ball. I brought it home for my roommates to try and they loved it all. But we all agreed if we came back, we would just get potato balls.As for me, I had to be there for a group meeting in the morning and had a ham and cheese croissant which was really just a ham n cheese croissant. You can't go wrong there. \u00a0I did order a blended cappuccino. I was really looking forward to trying it but when they called my number I saw black drizzle in it like a mocha blend. I asked the guy if it was a cappuccino and he said yes. I took it and was disappointed to have chocolate in my drink. I never knee chocolate was in a cappuccino. Kinda disappointed but I didn't wanna make a big deal about it.there was a lot of seating and the place was very spacious. I haven't been to the glendale one but everyone says its smaller and packed all the time. \u00a0It didn't seem that crowded to me. \u00a0there was a rush during lunch time, but it wasn't crazy as I thought it would be as everyone has been saying it gets CRAZY. \u00a0Overall, I would definitely come back to pick up some potatoes balls!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Diana D.", "time": "6/30/2011"}, {"content": "We have ordered from Portos a handful of times for company events. I particularly like their cheese rolls and their mini cheesecake tartlike pastries. I have tried their white and chocolate sheet cake and thought it was just ok.

Just avoid parking in the tiny lot. Street parking is completely free. Park two or three blocks down Magnolia and walk the distance. There are PLENTY of spots!Portos never fails to deliver. The end.I always go in, planning on trying something new, but I ALWAYS end up getting just two things: guava cheese rolls and cheese rolls. That's all anyone needs. Seriously, just skip the other stuff. Everything is delicious, but guava cheese is where it's at!Side note: I'm a vegetarian. For all you normal meat-eating folks, you should definitely get a few potato balls ($.90 each) too.

I used to work in the area and would come here for lunch several times a week. And when I say lunch, I really mean eating a bunch of treats and getting more to go. It's probably best that I don't live or work close to this place anymore. Portos' Parisian Chocolate Cake is my favorite cake ever. All of their desserts and pastries are great, but some other stand outs for me is the Opera Cake and Guava&Cheese Pastry. Don't forget to get a couple of potato balls also, I dreamed about them for days after I tried it the first time. The lines are always long, but they go by pretty quickly, and sometimes they come around with samples while you're waiting in line.

The taste of the sandwich was very one noted. I was expecting the garlic sauce to do the trick. The bread was delicious as most bakery breads are. Perhaps I was supposed to enjoy just the simple flavors of this sandwich. I also got my fix of Guava & Cheese Strudel, Potato Balls, and Meat Pie. After a while, puff pastry starts to all taste the same and makes your mouth really dry. So I def do not recommend you consume a whole box of pastries in one sitting. Parking is always packed, but people are constantly going in and out. I've managed to find parking every time ;). This place will be loud and filled with people, but then again that's what makes the atmosphere great. The service is fast and friendly as well. Note to self: Must try the coconut strudel, strawberry & cheese croissant, ham croquettes for next time!

It was not as tasty as I had hoped but was satisfying. The Roasted Pork sandwich was better though simple and understated. \u00a0Upon walking in you will be served plenty of eye candy and your head will spin with the number of choices you will have to make. \u00a0It's a good lunch (or quick, casual dinner) spot and one-stop shop for a good meal plus dessert.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Anna R.", "time": "5/4/2009"}, {"content": "One of my favorite Bakery!!
