[{"content": "I read numerous reviews on yelp, heard from a bunch of family members about Porto's. We missed the chance to eat here during memorial day weekend and this time I was not passing it up. We were getting ready for disneyland, my son wakes up early so we were up at 6am. We decided while the wife was getting ready to grab breakfast real quick and we were NOT disappointed.We started with 2 dozen cheese rolls, 1 dozen guava cream cheese strudels, 2 cuban sandwiches, 2 fresh orange juices (This food was for 6 people not just me). Let me start with cheese rolls, flaky cheesy goodness! The guava cream cheese strudels were just as good! There was nothing we did not like! We went back the next day, before we drove home before Roscoe's and ordered 1 dozen cheese rolls, 1 dozen guava strudels, 2 meat pies to try. We made a mistake not ordering a dozen meat pies, there were delicious!

It has grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, goat cheese, thin strings of red onion, and bean spread. Now that I think of it though, I don't remember getting any hint of flavor of goat cheese. Was it in there. I love that the onions are so thin that it doesn't overpower any bite. The bread had me coughing a few times as it's outer crust is pretty flaky from being toasted and a few pieces drifted down my throat as I took a bite. The bread was good if you eat it right away and quick...or it starts to get a little hard and can hurt the roof of your mouth. The banana chips that come with the sandwiches are always great. They sprinkle them with salt so they aren't too bland or boring. I usually sit outdoors if there are tables, but today was about 100 degrees. Sat inside at a table by the window and had I known they sometimes walk around with delicious bakery samples I might've sat inside more often. They came around with nice size portions of carrot cake and a chocolate dessert. I didn't need to go back through the long line for a pastry. That rocks my socks!!Service is friendly. Parking: Private lot around back which can be crowded. And there always seems to be at least one confused idiot going the wrong way. =/ Street parking too if you can find one.

I have been going to Portos for over 20 years when they were a little tiny hole in the wall in glendale before they bought the numero uno pizza next door and expanded it as an addition to add a coffee bar. Between Glendale and Burbank I prefer the Burbank location because of it's location and newness as well as the atmosphere. You can never go wrong with anything you order. From Potato balls to chocolate croissants to Guava and cheese. I have been ordering cakes from there as well. It's affordable, and good. The only downside is the wait but just like anywhere else it's worth it. Rockin Raffi's Recommendation's go early morning on sunday before church and get all your num num's and you will be satisfied. For lunch I recommend the pork sandwich (The pork is marinated and slow cooked so you can taste the softness in your mouth) or steak torta depending on your mood. \u00a0For ordering cakes I have tried Tres leeches, Perisian which is Chocolate heaven and Strawberry shortcake. Hard to say which one of these are my most favorite because they all rock!... Hope this review was helpful. Now what are you waiting for order some Potato Balls.

The potato balls and chorizo & egg sandwich on Cuban bread were both amazing! By far my favorite items. Not far behind was the cheese roll, soo good.

There's not much I can say beyond what the masses have already stated, so I'll just stick to what I ordered. Guava Cheese Strudel-I never thought a danish could be this good. My jaw dropped when I first bit into it. I could taste the guava with every bite with the cheese providing a subtle cheesy aftertaste. It is a wonderful blend of sweet and salty. Red Velvet Cupcake-While not necessarily a contender with the likes of Sprinkles, it blows away Magnolia Bakery and many other bakeries that attempt to sell cupcakes. The frosting was made of a cream cheese mix and provided a dense, filling mouthful with each bite. The cupcake itself was slightly on the drier side, but thankfully the frosting came to the rescue. Potato Balls-It's as though you just bit into mashed potatoes filled with ground beef and diced veggies. \u00a0It's nothing I've ever experienced... and love it to death each and every time I order it. \u00a0At $.90 a pop, you can fill yourself up for a very small sum of money.Almond Danish-I found it strange that when you first bite into the Almond Danish... that you don't get an immediate \"WOW!\" effect. \u00a0Instead, it's a nod-your-head, chew, think.... then WOW! \u00a0There's something like an almond paste / spread / something that takes awhile to set on your taste buds as \u00a0you chew. \u00a0It doesn't come right away, but when it does, you'll be glad you ordered it. \u00a0It's sweet, but not too sweet. \u00a0It's perfect.The service is great, the employees are very friendly, and the prices are fantastic! \u00a0Think of Porto's as a New York bakery escape from the conventional LA bakeries you may be used to. \u00a0You won't know what hit you!5 Stars without hesitation.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Johnson N.", "time": "2/28/2011"}, {"content": "What can I say that hasn't already been said?! \u00a0The place is truly amazing! \u00a0Yes, it's always crowded and it is almost impossible to get a seat inside the bakery, but even if you just take it home and eat it there, it's well worth it. \u00a0I've been here more than a handful of times, so here's a little rundown of my experiences.Every sandwich I've tried, I've liked!
