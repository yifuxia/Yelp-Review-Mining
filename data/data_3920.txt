Cheese rolls. Potato Balls. Guava Cheese rolls. They were also handing out samples of the strawberry shortcake while I was standing in line, and it was sooooo good! Ended up ordering two pieces!It's been incredibly hard not to spend $50+ on baked goods and end up with 6+ boxes of pastries to bring back to the Bay area.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Agnes L.", "time": "11/14/2011"}, {"content": "You can't go wrong with Porto's. The food's always delicious, especially anything from the bakery, and everything is so reasonably priced. There's always a line, but they understand how to get people through quickly.

Everything! That will explain the packed parking lot and long lines, particularly in the Bakery section. Weekends are jammed! I recommend going on a weeknight for a quick bite to eat. The plantano-chips that come with the sandwich sides are delightful as well!I just wish they had a bigger drink selection -- more juices, etc. And longer hours for dinner.

The people are super helpful and the prices are very reasonable. The Dulce De Leches Kisses were very good, and different from anything i've had. The cookie itself was a delicious shortbread style and the inside dulce de leche was perfect, sweet and buttery. Just delish :) Onto the flan, which, another sweet treat, creamy and most importantly not overly sweet. \u00a0Paired with the biscotti, not the Italian style super crunchy kind but a softer crunchy kind almost like a butter cookie. Needless to say, not what I had expected, but definitely pleasant surprise, the vanilla and almond was quite aromatic. The drink I decided to get, the Mango smoothie was very refreshing, not artificial and grossly sweet. The fresh squeezed orange juice which I also tried was very good and a nice addition to our quick snack break. Overall, great bakery and cafe, and would come back again :) *(one tip the place does get very packed, so try to come early to avoid the rush)", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Danika K.", "time": "5/27/2012"}, {"content": "Did not see what all the hype was about.

Holy crap, this place is AMAZING.We went around lunchtime when it was fairly busy. They have a tiny parking lot, so it took ages to find a spot. The restaurant is huge and laid out a lot like Bottega Louie, with a display case full of delicious-looking pastries and a menu you can order sandwiches and other lunch fare off of. I got the chicken torta sandwich, which was incredible. The bread was so soft, the chicken was well-seasoned, and I loved the fried bananas they used instead of chips. I also tried one of their famous potato balls -- best decision of my life. They're basically fried balls of mashed potatoes with ground beef inside. I can't say I'd be upset if I had to eat them for the rest of my life.I had a fruit tart for dessert (I was stuffed by that point, but I couldn't resist trying at least one of their pastries) and I loved it. The fruit didn't have that mushy, week-old preserved taste most fruit tarts usually have. The crust was sweet and crunchy, and everything tasted great together.The best part of Porto's was how cheap it was. I got all of that for only $10. I wish it wasn't so far away... I'd go there all the time.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Annie Y.", "time": "1/19/2011"}, {"content": "This bakery serves well when you want a filling snack.

Last year around Christmas I was lucky enough to be dating/seeing a girl who bought a Porto cake. Relationship didnt last, but the memory burned into my memory from the cake has lasted for a long long time. Then a year later different time different place different girl different circumstance I was brought again another Porto pastry and this solidified the deal that I needed to go and experience this place for my own.Ambience: Place is effffffing huge. I was completely shocked at the sheer size of a freaking bakery being this gigantic. Upon entering at 3pm on freaking wednesday I had to wait in a good 10m line. Freaking ridiculous. But the overall actual aesthetics plus the friendly customer service really upped my overall impression and contributed to the good mood that was ensuing. What I ate: I had pretty much a dabble of everything. From Cheese rolls, potato balls, to freaking tarts empanadas etc.. All of them were a-mazing no doubt. Conclusion: The best way to describe this new experience is something the customer service representative shared with my mother. My mother was asking what a certain pastry was, and the women(female hispanic) explained in spanish that these were guava/mango rolls symbolizing the sweetness of leaving their dear Cuba, and the bitterness of being away from home. In all the commotion in all the stir of things I was somewhat brought to tears with the sincerity and earnestness that this employee brought to me and my mom. Overall great experience good food, and amazing. go", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Wesley M.", "time": "9/30/2011"}, {"content": "I really don't know how they do it here....quite puzzling, actually....you walk in, and it looks like a line at six flags...you get in line, and you're just walking the whole time...next thing you know, they're asking for the next customer in line....and it's you! Always busy, but super fast. Not too many places that can kill a line like that.Some of the best pastries ever!!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "suzie b.", "time": "2/6/2011"}]
