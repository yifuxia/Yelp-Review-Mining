[{"content": "I can't say enough good things about Porto's!It's delicious and incredibly inexpensive.Here are my favorites:Turkey/Cheese Croissant Sandwich (Buttery and Delicious)Potato Ball (OMG! Amazing!)Cheese Roll (Sweet and Salty)Chocolate Covered Strawberries (Much better deal than online. And fresh)Cheesecake (Any flavor. It's the best)Guava Smoothie (One of the only places to get it)Almond Danish (YUM)Flan (Authentic and Delicious)Tres Leches (Moist and Decadent)I'm probably forgetting something but it's all delicious. You really can't go wrong.One thing to keep in mind is that Porto's has a very specific way to order. When you go in you can either go to the right or left. You will be able to order anything from either side, but the right has more cakes and baked goods to look at and point to. When you get to the front of the line, someone from behind the counter will say, \"Next Customer\" and then you will go to them and tell them what you want. Wait for them to get everything and then direct you to one of the registers. Pay for your items and if you have a sandwich they will give you a number. Walk over to the far left corner and wait until your number is called.The process is a little confusing the first time but then you get how it works. You can also get your food to go or get a table number and have it brought to you. Either way the food is delicious and it's a place you will come to over and over again.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Mary S.", "time": "5/17/2011"}, {"content": "Love this place!

If I'm craving a cheese roll or a turkey croissant sandwich, I just drive a few blocks and I'm here at the famous Portos Bakery.

I enjoy bringing people from out of town here to see the variety of pastries and savories. My favorites are: cheese roll, guava cheese roll, creme brulee, fruit tart, caramel eclair, flan, chicken croquette, and meat pies. The fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious as well. I have had a couple sandwiches here to (if you order sandwiches to eat there they come with fried plantain chips- if you order to go you do not get any chips!) the chips are awesome! So make sure you try those too.
