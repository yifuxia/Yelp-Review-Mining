Everything tasted good, but it wasn't close to heaven. Prices are very reasonable!As a first timer, you should look at their website and get an idea of what you want to order before you get there, because it's organized chaos once you get inside. The workers move fast and there's a billion people swarming around the glass, so you better make your selections fast. All the sandwiches and plantain chips looked great though.

Every so often when im walking up to the main entrance ill see a nice Portos employee pushing a cart which is carrying \u00a0a few boxes of who knows what kind of Portos goodness is inside. One can only imagine it being filled with the meat pies in its flaky decadence or lined full of chorizo empanadas. Maybe one box is lightly stacked and crowded with their oh so yummy guava pastries or maybe its a combination of beef balls, cheese rolls and perhaps a slice of tres leches cake?Am i drifting?..okay back to how i feel. Whenever i see the nice, friendly Portos employee walking out with the cart i always ask myself..\"okay if i really really wanted to highjack this delivery..what could i do?\" I then imagine myself wearily but anxiously pulling out a gun out of my waist and scaring the Portos employee so that i can take the boxes with me.

My wallet was stolen out of my purse today and they did not want to do anything about it since they stated their hands were tied. All of my cash was stolen and My Starbucks cards. Who effing takes a Starbucks card?! The main person who I spoke to was general manager, Brenda. She showed me the surveillance video of the family, yes, a little girl, mother, and her male companion do the crime. The little girl nudged me and I thought nothing of it, even though there was no one behind her. On the video, you can see the woman walk behind me while holding a small phone, and after, you see her holding my wallet and zipping it open. Then you see the guy talking to the woman while she was smiling and looking back to see where I was seated and see if I had noticed. Please note, Brenda was rushing me while she was showing me the video because she said she was being called downstairs, even though there were two other managers on site. Andy, the other general manager stated that, \"It was just a theft.\" I wanted to speak to Betty, but Brenda just handed me the business card and told me to call the Downey or Glendale branches since she was not in Burbank and doubted she was in the other two and just to leave a message. Did I mention that she was smiling the WHOLE time? She stated that there was no surveillance cameras at the parking lot, but I confirmed with Bobby, the other general manager that there was a camera. I know that the Burbank PD will take care of it and I am in good hands with the Burbank PD.P.S. If you want some bolilos, watch your wallet.
