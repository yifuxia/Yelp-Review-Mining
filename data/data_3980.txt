Just look at how many reviews there are for this place as well as their Glendale branch. To me, Porto's is all about the bakery and pastry. Superb and always great to bring to co-workers, birthdays, any other occasions. I finally experienced their sandwiches. The media noche was pretty good but I really enjoyed my beef fajita sandwich. The banana (plantain) chips were whatever. Of course as everyone knows, the only drawback to this place is that it is so popular that it's always packed. The line is usually crazy but for the most part, it moves swiftly. Their hot soy latte (cafe con leche) is really good but their iced caramel coffee was mediocre. If you go on the weekends or during busy hours, be prepared to wait in line a bit.

I enjoy the Cuban cake and their red velvet cupcake with an actual rose petal on top. Their tres leches is ok. My favorite baked item is their guava roll.

I would go back there again for sandwiches and potato balls. They had many different varieties of cakes. They were big and good looking.
