After years of trying to come here, I've finally met my goal! This place is huge! I didn't expect Portos to have such a wide assortment of goodies?!! I wish I had more time to decide on what I wanted but because of the heavy traffic of people and busy service, I felt rushed which I'm not mad at, it just came with territory.I had their guava cheese pastries, cheese rolls and their dulce de leche fingerprints. These all tasted amazing! I also liked their Cubano sandwich; it wasn't like the ones in Miami but it was still good tasting regardless. For $6 this sandwich is a steal!I thought their dulce de leche blended drink was ok. It tasted like a caramel Frapp from Sbux. Nothing exciting here. I haven't seen any other pastry/dessert place with the prices they have here at Portos. Here at Portos, their treats are highly affordable and high quality. It truly works.

I did however visit the Downey location recently and would like to compare my two visits, both at Downey and Burbank. I went in to purchase a birthday cake on both occasions. My experience at Downey Porto's left me in shock! Being that they were super busy, they handled each and every customer in such a professional manner. Everyone was so coordinated and on top of their job task. I had never seen such amazing customer service, since these things are rare nowadays. \u00a0(I want to learn from their management team!!! Because whatever they are doing/saying to their employees is working) My experience at Burbank Porto's was horrible. The moment i entered, i was expecting to experience the same type of service/environment as the Downey location, but boy was i wrong. As i walked to the cake section, i noticed two employees just standing by the register and having a long lovey conversation as if they are alone in the room. (Uhhh) hello?!? There are people in line!!!!! There was only one employee taking orders by the glass case, writing the birthday wishes on the chocolate, and ringing up customers. If only one employee is handling all these responsibilities, what is the job title of the two standing at the cash register conversing? 10-15 mins in line they finally stop talking and the cash register girl starts ringing. Burbank Porto's, i didn't get a sense of your employees willingness to assist your paying customers. Super bummed. The food/baked goods are 5 stars all the way.Your employees and their willingness to help assist your paying customers... 3 stars if not 2.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Ann K.", "time": "9/19/2016"}, {"content": "Dear Porto's,Y'all seriously need to open up a place in NorCal otherwise my family in LA is going to have to keep coming here to bring me home some goodies. Think about all the business you can make by adding a branch up here! I only visit SoCal less than five times a year and every time I drive down to LA I always have to hit up Porto's.No matter what time you go, the lines will always be long. Whether you arrive at 7 am or before closing time, this place is busy and I think it's pretty obvious as to why. CHEESE ROLLS. Yummy delicious rolls that have descended from the heavens. I cannot even describe how perfect they are. You need to try one. Actually no, you need to get a box or two, or three, actually nah you better go get five dozens. It'll be gone within three days (haha jk, not really). Potato balls! Yummy meaty balls of goodness. It kinda reminds me of the Filipino dish, Beef Giniling, except rolled into a ball, wrapped in potato hash, and breaded and fried. Mmmmmm. You can ask for them to serve it to you piping hot or room temp. Make sure to get room temp if it's not going to be eaten right away, otherwise it'll get soggy. Cheese Rolls and Potato Balls are my go-to's but they have so many cakes and pastries that are just as delicious. The Tres leches, fruit tart, and cheesecake are some of my family's favorites. Try avoiding the Chicken Croquettes, definitely not a fan of them and probably the only baked good I don't like from this joint. Make sure to order ahead of time (24 hours before) if you want to order a giant box/dozens and dozens of cheese rolls to avoid the line. Just set a pick up time and make sure to pick up your order at the catering/pick-up line. You can also add to your order once you're picking it up! It's a great way to have to avoid going back in line if you want to buy some extra goodies. If you ordered the cheese rolls in bulk, add $1 if you want them to organize your cheese rolls into a nice platter with strawberries and such.Porto's, my love, till we meet again!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Tiffany R.", "time": "6/28/2016"}, {"content": "Best service.

We arrived at the opening hour and stood in line, that's how popular it is. I don't doubt it- the foods, smells, everything, amazing. I just found my blueberry muffin to be... ok? I've had better at some gas stations that bring in fresh baked foods. It wasn't warm, which I kind of expected being there so early in the morning.

My favorite food item is their grilled chicken sandwich, potato balls, cheese rolls, and guava cheese rolls. The plantain chips that come with the sandwich is also very good.
