[{"content": "Ordered a 1/4 sheet cake from here for a co-workers post wedding office party and was very pleased! \u00a0I ordered the strawberry shortcake (the lady on the phone who I placed the order with said the milk n berries cake was he most popular flavor but I looked it up online and the sheet cake version is a little too messy looking). \u00a0I really wanted the Congratulations writing to be on the face of the cake since I really didn't like the look of the cakes posted on yelp with the writing on a separate piece of white chocolate . \u00a0After that fact, I can say I'm \u00a0happy with how the cake looked and with that decision! \u00a0The cake was $38.50 and served well over 20 people. \u00a0It was also surprisingly heavy! \u00a0The cake was delicious and creamy but still felt light and not too sweet. \u00a0I was given a frosting option and went with the whipped cream which I was told was less sweet. \u00a0I think the other choice was buttercream that is a lot sweeter.Everyone broke their diets to have some cake and some people even took some home! \u00a0I would absolutely recommend Porto's for advanced cake orders for parties. \u00a0They were very friendly and helpful on the phone when I placed the order and when I picked up the cake, the two women who helped me were efficient and very nice as well.What a pleasant experience!

Gotta get there early to beat the line.

Every time I go I get the guava strudel and a sandwhich with beans and guac (i dont know what its called I always describe it and they understand me) lol. My family only gets any cake from there now. Any birthday or mothers day we get the neopolitan cake. In El Salvador we call it Mil hojas but so far this ones better (dont tell my grandma). We always get potato balls and crockets to go. Lately I've loved the empanadas. During lent they had some seafood crocket which wasnt so good but althought he lines out the door its abou 15 min once youre in. Longest line i have ever made was on a holiday 15min outside and 15 min inside but it was worth it.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Belle P.", "time": "5/31/2016"}, {"content": "Best best cakes ever!!!

At times, the line here goes out the building. Just when I started to question why I waited so long (long for me is anything over 15 min) I bit into a potato ball and that answered my question. I then ate the cheese roll and that was Porto's way of saying shut up and never question us again haha. Not to mention, they have this new CHEESE BALL that was in a way insulting (in a good way) to any other cheese balls ever made. LolI don't know how they do it but time and time again I envy their talent on how they produce these amazing pastries/food at such consistency.If you've never tried Porto's it's worth the wait and I rarely say that.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Eugene P.", "time": "9/27/2015"}, {"content": "mmmMMMmmmmm! it's a beautiful thing when the food lives up to the hype. The spread for two @ 8AM on a sunny Saturday morning (after a 10 min wait in a quickly moving line): Potato balls - i had no idea they were stuffed with meat! the most pleasant of all surprises!Cheese and pepper balls - the gf really liked these. i thought they were good, but a bit too cheesy para mi. definitely worth trying though. Meat pie - so good. the outside is almost croissant like - flaky and slightly sweet and pairs with the inside to be food perfection.Ham and cheese croissant - yum yum yum. very flaky outside, savory inside. also tried a guava roll which wasnt that great - it was about 70% hard breading and 30% guava filling. wouldn't get that one again but next time im in the area ill be trying more!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Timothy H.", "time": "10/9/2015"}, {"content": "I love, love this place!

But boy is it worth it. The potato balls are ridiculously good. I also enjoyed a Cuban, which is definitely recommended. Great crunch in the bread and perfectly pressed. The cheese rolls were also good. My friend had one of their croquette balls... Not sure what kind. I'll have to update this once I find out what she had. The only downside I will say about Porto's is that I always feel rushed. It's always so busy... And the staff does what they can to help... But I never feel like I can take my time and find something truly unique or new. I always seem to gravitate to the Cuban and some assortment of potato balls. If you're around Burbank it's definitely worth the stop... Just be prepared to wait. I always take some to go...

However, because the place is so overrated and popular, the lines are always pretty long! Last time, I had a cubano and I was pleased. It was delicious. I always get the cheese and guava pastry and the cheese puff pastry thing. SO good. Of course, also can't leave without having a potato balls. Balls have never tasted so good!! I have in the past also had their cakes as well as their feta sandwich and I have never had anything I did not love. If this review were for the food only it would be 4 1?2 for sure. Whenever the food has been brought by people to events, it is always a big hit!! That being said, to get to that point means someone had to have the 3 star experience of waiting in long lines to order and then waiting som emore to pick up all of the delicious food. I recommend coming here during the week on an off hour. Either between breakfast and lunch or between lunch and dinner. If you come at peak hours, you will hate yourself.

There is a reason why everyone speaks so highly of Porto's and why there is almost always a line to order. Anywhere I have eaten in the Burbank area that I thought the bread was amazing explains that it came from Porto's. \u00a0While the wait and parking situation is frustrating at times it is very worth the wait. Sometimes while waiting they offer samples of the pastry options and I don't even like sweets, but this place has lured me over to the sweet side!Breakfast until 11 and lunch all day. My personal favorite here is the caprese and \u00a0Cubano and to drink the The Cuban coffee is a winner.
