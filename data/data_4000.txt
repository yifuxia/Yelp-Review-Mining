After dinner, we each had one, and I thought I was going to pass out from delight. Even after a 5 1/2 hour flight from California, these babies tasted incredibly fresh, with a subtly sweet cheesiness and lots and lots of happy layers. The richness of the pastry and that subtle sweetness is reminiscent of something decadent I once had when I was little, but at this moment I can't put my finger on it. All I know is -- they bring back very sweet memories.

It's not overly greasy. It is quite satisfying and as much as I'd want more, 2 at a time is about as much as i should eat :) but ooooh i want more.The meat pies and other croquettes (i.e chicken and ham) are ok. The creamy texture of the croquettes are nice, but i think i prefer a little more to chew on (more chunks of meat, esp the ham one). But the flavor is very good. The meat pie is so so. I think the flakey pastry is wonderful! but the filling could be a little more filled. The cheese pastries are good. Not too heavy not too sweet. I esp liked the one with guava and prefer that to the regular. Again the flakey pastry is awesome :) Pass on the apple empanada. The crust is a bit dense and the apple filling only so-so. Plus there wasn't really enough filling to balance out with the crust. With so much other great stuff, it's really not worth it. Coffee was good :) On other occasions I've had their chocolate cake and their mango cake. Both very delicious. Moist cake, light frosting. Great flavor.

Definitely try the traditional Cuban delights like croquettes, but even global sweets like Challah and Croissants outdo their native progenitors. I can't say enough good things about this place.

Short story...Sandwich was super tasty, salad lacked any real flavor and was too oily, and the potato balls, aside from being a bit on the salty side, were very yummy. I would go back.
