The lines are always long, but they go by very quickly. \u00a0It gets a little hectic with all the people, but everyone behind the counter is very friendly, especially if it's your first time. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable, so don't be afraid to get a ton of different things! \u00a0I am definitely coming back and am always excited to try new things there!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Marie G.", "time": "10/18/2011"}, {"content": "Great food the fam loved it!!!

They enlarged the original space in Glendale then built this beautiful restaurant-bakery in Burbank. Pride shows in everything they do here, as far as running things, keeping it clean, managing orders and the respect they show customers. The high-ceilinged room with warm decor touches has a Cuban/European feel - \"class\" without being the least bit intimidating.They do get a ton of customers, but they're very efficient so the line goes quite fast, which gives you an extra minute to eyeball all the colorful, gem-like goodies in the display case. They have one main parking lot plus one side lot, plus a good number of nearby street spaces. It really isn't a problem getting in here unless you're the type that gets an anxiety attack if you don't find a space ten feet from the front door.I have the same favorites as most people - cheese rolls, potato balls, chicken caesar salad, apple strudel, ANY of the pastries and specialty cheesecakes (we bought a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for the office and people went nuts. The shaved white chocolate on top stood 7\" high and I have to say, the cake itself was the loveliest thing I have ever tasted.) I also like the baked ham and cheese croissant (in the hot case, not the sandwich you order off the menu); it has GOOD quality ham plus gruyere cheese, baked and melted to perfection. At under $2 it's an insane bargain. Not so fond of the ham croquettes which remind me of warm cat food, and I'm not a fan of guava jam which is featured in some of the pastries. Personal taste. I don't think there's anything wrong with any of their products; some traditional items are for that particular trade, and I don't see anybody complaining!Breads and cakes to go: Love the olive and herb-infused loaves, and their cakes are reliably fabulous without the Crisco frosting or cheap ingredients that mar most commercial cakes. They are works of art, fantastic with color, mirror surfaces, stenciled designs, flowers etc.I also like their version of tamales, which are cooked in foil and are somewhat soupy, with pork nuggets and grains of corn in a tomato / meat stock-colored masa, making them slightly orange. Oh don't miss the fresh, strong dark coffee and a cup of fresh-squeezed OJ - or a can of Inka Kola if you're so inclined.This is a 15 mile drive for me, but when I go, I have wings on my feet!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "suzanne b.", "time": "3/27/2011"}, {"content": "I was super excited to try this place since it had such huge reviews on Yelp. I ordered way too much and had lunch for two days. The line was long, but moved very quickly. I was in & out of the parking lot in a cinch so no problems there.Here are my food ramblings:Potato Balls - they were good, but not raving mad great like everyone says lolChicken Croquette - a little dry. Think hush puppy with a dab of chicken in it.Ham Croquette - more breading than any ham goodness, boo!Cuban Sandwich - basic, nothing to write home about. Chorizo Meat Pie - flaky and goodCheese Roll - yummy, I ate this one first!So the best selling point to this place? The prices are great for the amount of food you get. I wouldn't order a sandwich again. I'd rather make it a Tapas plate, and splurge on dessert and a delectable beverage.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Cathy T.", "time": "12/1/2011"}, {"content": "sandwiches are good but phone orders are usually wrong.
