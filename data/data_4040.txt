This place is horrible - customer service AND food. I could probably make a better sandwich blind-folded using only my elbows, and Asians aren't even a sandwich people! Their sandwiches give the word \"stale\" its definition and redefine the word \"tasteless\" altogether. As for customer service, my experience was as follows: I faxed in my order at 11am. I called to confirm but was put on hold until 11:20, when they told me the fax machine wasn't working, and I had to put my huge order in via phone. Okay, so far, not a big deal. I'm forgiving of technological malfunctions. I get there at 12:10. They had said my order would be ready by 12:15. I instead waited around until 12:30 for someone to even begin helping. The servers walked right past me without even asking to help, all 20 of them by the preorder counter. My blood begins to boil. Two girl servers were straight up having a slumber party/giggle fest in the corner, dodging work. The only person giving me any sort of attention was a gay guy, who kept trying to make eye contact. I'm a friend of the gay but was not exactly in the mood to be objectified. When the two girl servers finally get over how much of a \"puto\" Miguel is, one of them decides to help me. She gets my order ready by 12:45. I trusted her to get my order right (not sure why). And of course, I realize back at the office we are missing seven mf-ing potato balls. Girl, for real? That's seven angry ass potato ball craving people in my office!The lesson I learned from all this: I feel you, Miguel. And fuck the valley.

I've been going to the one in Glendale and now this location for a couple of years now and I gotta say this place constantly has business, especially during the holiday season! They have a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts to choose from, mostly everything is Cuban based. They also offer items such as potato balls ( think mash potatoes that had been rolled into balls with a yummy meat filling, then breaded and fried...), empanadas, croissants, coffee cakes, and much more. At this particular location, there are three areas to place your order. To the far left of the front door you have the area to order for quick items for a meal (aka salads, sandwiches, desserts) and drinks (coffee, smoothie, etc). The center location allows you to order a wider variety of items including things such as their cheese rolls, whole cakes, or meal items. The last area is to the far right of the door where you can place orders for large cakes. During the lunch rush it is incredibly hard to find parking and you can't park in the residential area because your car will be towed- seeing as how the residents keep an eye on the cars that park at the curb.

(my mouth waters thinking of it)... and then I make sure I always end my meal with one of their pastries for desert...from cakes to cupcakes, to chocolate covered strawberries, everything is delicious, and the best part of it is it is always never too sweet...they're always just right and taste like they were freshly made/baked. \u00a0Before I leave I make sure to buy me a dozen cheese rolls to go. \u00a0(Great for breakfast the next day). \u00a0Porto's dips into everything from sandwiches, soups, \u00a0to deserts and coffee's... so if you're not so much into pastries they do have other items on their menu that can cater to you.Their cakes are gorgeous to the eye and i'm sure they taste as good as they look. \u00a0I would love to receive a birthday cake from Porto's or even give one to a birthday celebrant. \u00a0That'd be like the best present ever. \u00a0lol.Despite the long lines (which is always almost all the time), the service is quick so I never find myself waiting for too long. \u00a0But even if there was a wait it would be worth it. \u00a0I can't say that about too many places. \u00a0The only downfall is their parking. \u00a0If the parking lot is full you'll be forced to park in the street and it's almost always full every time I go there. \u00a0You just have to get lucky with it, or go on a weekday when they're less busy. \u00a0Other then that I definitely recommend this place to those who love their sweets. \u00a0I live about 30 minutes away and still feel it is worth the drive everytime...
