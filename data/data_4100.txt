The line for the baked goods is well worth the waited as you admire the many pastries at the long counter. The prices are incredibly inexpensive as I thought these was going to be on the expensive side, I guess wrong and was surprise to walk out of the bakery for less than $10.00!!

Porto's cakes and baked goods are works of art, beautiful and delicious, much anticipated by all of my officemates.What pleasantly surprised me was the first time I went there for a coffee and a pastry when I happened to be in that neighborhood running errands on a Saturday morning were a couple of things: First, value. I ordered a 16 oz. latte and two pastries because I couldn't decide on which to order--and my bill was just under $5. Try doing that at a Starbucks.Second, efficiency. I was completely unsurprised to find the place \u00a0packed mid-morning on a weekend--but Porto's is a well-oiled machine, moving the masses through the line for edibles, then beverages. I thought it'd take 20 minutes to get through the line, it was easily less than half that.I've also been back for a light dinner with a friend who lives near there, and their savories--well, just do yourself a favor and order a Cuban sandwich and the potato balls like all the rest of the good people of Yelp advise.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Drew F.", "time": "6/23/2011"}, {"content": "I've had Porto's cheese rolls on numerous occasions, but I've never had them fresh.

For those of you who have had them because a co-worker brought them to work or a friend brought a box to a potluck, go straight to Porto's and eat them there! You won't regret it!Okay enough of the cheese rolls! My party ordered the following sandwiches: Cubano, Pastrami, Ham & Cheese and the Feta. \u00a0All were really good, but the sandwiches wouldn't be the reason why I would go back.So what would make me come back? Obviously, the cheese rolls, but on top of that, the POTATO BALLS!! They are delicious! A soft mashed potato ball stuffed with seasoned ground beef and fried? Doesn't sound appealing, but it is AMAZING!! IMO, skip the sandwiches and order a few potato balls, a box of cheese rolls and some other pastries (my daughter loved their chocolate croissant) and enjoy your meal. \u00a0Quick tip: Once you walk in, go to the line to your right.
