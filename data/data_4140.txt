Having grown up in the 626 area, I've always been used to Chinese/Asian bakeries. Porto's is really different from other bakeries that I'm familiar with, but this place definitely delivers. The line gets pretty crazy here, but it's not unbearable. My favorite items are the Cuban Sandwich, Potato Balls, Guava Cheese Rolls, and the Dulche de Leche Latte. Everything is really hearty and delicious, and prices are pretty low! Also, don't be fooled by the potato balls.. They look pretty small, but they really expand in your stomach haha.

All you really need to know is that they have potato balls. Ground beef with various secret seasonings surrounded by flavorful mashed potatoes... take all of that and then deep fry it. It's simple and you wonder why these balls of glory aren't available anywhere and everywhere. Go to Portos.Now you know about the potato balls, but let me tell you more. Pastries and danishes of every sort! The cheese danish, perfect equilibrium of savory and sweet. And if you're leaning on the sweet side, go for the guava danish. (Or mango mousse.) (Or almond danish.) Leaning to the salty? The spinach feta croissant is nom.I'm probably the most irritating customer because I tend to go to the counter because I can never go to the counter with a prepare order. It's always \"make that two of the potatoe balls, no wait. six of them.\" and somehow ends with a \"can I add three more of the balls?\". The staff is always extremely nice anyways.

It's a good place for family, groups and you don't have to really keep your voice down because the main eating area is like a great dining hall with high ceiling and a skylight...I think. The price for everything especially the cakes is very reasonable. I always bring visitors here and they'd love it every time.

If I were to write solely based on their bakery, they would receive 5 stars. This morning, I went here for breakfast (first time having a meal from here that wasn't cake). I walked in around 9:15 am and it was extremely busy, like usual. They had more employees taking orders than there were cash registers, which is a thoughtful idea in theory, but when employees start fighting for registers and making people wait to pay, it gets a little messy. After finally landing a register to pay at, I ordered my veggie sandwich. My heart was broken when they told me I can't order that sandwich until 10am... There's two different sandwich menus, one is available all day and the other one can't be ordered off of until 10am. I'm not quite sure what the reason behind that is, especially considering that both menus had the same ingredients and breads, just jumbled around. I was offered a similar sandwich, the Feta, which consisted of almost the same veggies, just with feta. So I ordered that without the cheese and asked for wheat bread. I got my sandwich on a white roll. It was literally two tomatoes with some onions and oil on a piece of bread. My friend looked at it and laughed at the poor, pathetic \"sandwich\". I know that I ordered the sandwich without cheese, but that thing would have been just as scarce with cheese on it. It was a sad attempt. I felt cheated in a way, like I didn't get my money's worth. I got two pieces of bread with some tomatoes. I know their other menu items are really great, but I say this like I say about most restaurants, they're not vegan friendly. Their service (minus my friendly cashier) is sub-par. Their employees look like they're tired and angry.3 stars.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Dani K.", "time": "3/22/2013"}, {"content": "Always amazon pastries and sandwiches. \u00a0Gotta love the raspberry cookies and turkey croissant.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "B B.", "time": "7/9/2013"}, {"content": "Portos is always awesome I love their ham sandwich and chocolate cake.Hit them up", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Miguel V.", "time": "12/7/2011"}, {"content": "I live 6 hours away and I would make road trips just for good eats!
