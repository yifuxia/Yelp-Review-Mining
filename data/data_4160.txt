When you buy more than 10 dozen of their stuff make sure that you count your boxes before going out.

This review is NOT about the quality of their product. \u00a0Their pastries and sandwiches are flavorful and satisfying. I'm updating my previous review because, for the 1st time in YEARS, Porto's has lacked in customer service. I've always admired their attention to service even with their extremely busy shop but this past week I went in to purchase a cake and stood in the WHOLE CAKES ONLY line. I watched as people before me ordered whole cakes and much more. This took a considerable amount of time but I understood, who can pass up potato balls? When it came for me to order a cake I placed my order and waited as the rep prepared it for purchase. He walked towards the register and as I reached for my money TWO Porto's employees stood in front of me. I assumed they were doing WORK so I stepped back, but they were ordering or paying for their lunch during their breaktime. I sat back and waited over 6-7 minutes as the rep that was assisting me was trying to figure how to ring up their order. I was furious! I paced back and forth and made it obvious I was getting frustrated. The rep then, after taking the time to ring up the employees, rang up my order. I didn't want to make a fuss since I do LOVE their product but when you work in Customer Service the Customer comes first. I thought it was poor judgment on the part of the rep ringing me up to help his co-workers over me and instead of having them order in front of customers they should have a register designated to employees!!

My friends from LA would occasionally bring back cheese rolls from Porto's to school in the Diego, so that was when I fell in love with their cheese rolls. Every time I drive back down to Socal, or drive back up from Socal, my family always has to drop by Porto's.My faves: cheese rolls and the potato balls! DROOOOL. But the potato balls are only good when they're fresh, in my opinion. If you let it sit in your fridge overnight or something, it's not as savory as when it is fresh. Last time I went there, my mom order the Pan con lechon sandwich, and it was also really yummyyy. Their prices are GREAT, too! Porto's is always crackin' every time I go. Highly recommend this place.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Michele L.", "time": "7/31/2011"}, {"content": "This Porto's location is just as big as the Downey store, but parking is a bit harder. The lot is small with some limited street parking. Funny enough, but there was traffic on the city streets because of people trying to find parking at Porto's - that's how popular this place gets! Since we were near Universal Studios already, it was an easy location to stop by to pick up some potato balls and guava pastries before heading home to Northern California. For the ride home, I also tried the Strawberry and Orange Blast smoothies.

Lines are long, but well worth it.They make their own orange juice through this really cool thingy ma-jig.

First off, don't expect to be in & out of this place. Every trip I've made here included long lines, and weekends are usually even longer! But, it's always worth it to me. Parking sucks. It's street parking, so I always walk like a block to this place. If you eat in, it takes time to find a table so always have someone save a table while you're in line. Also, the pricing isn't that bad. Most desserts are like $2.50, at least the ones I get.I recommend potato balls, which are like 85 cents each, cheese rolls, like 65 cents each. As for desserts, which is the MAIN reason why I go, I get a napolean and caramel ecclair. \u00a0And, If I'm real hungry, I usually get the turkey melt sandwich. The sandwich consists of turkey, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard on sourdough. I'm not a mustard fan, and had no idea it was in it, but it tasted good on the sandwich. I love how the sandwiches come with plantain chips!The sandwich and desserts never fail me. The only down side of this place is that you have to stand in a long line, but at least it isn't like Disneyland long!
