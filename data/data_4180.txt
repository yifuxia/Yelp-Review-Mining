[{"content": "This place is going to make me fat. But I don't mind, if it means I get to eat their Mango Mousse. And their Cubano sandwich with plantines on the side. And their Tres Leches cake. And...oh forget it...so I love everything they have. This place is AMAZING and I'm never surprised to see that every time I come, it is PACKED with customers left and right. Surprisingly enough, the lines for the bakery are so quick because they are well-equipped with a friendly staff. The tiny desserts usually go for about $2.60 each which is a great deal, considering that you'd get the same thing for about $6 \u00a0at a cafe in K-Town. \u00a0They have addicting guava rolls and cheese rolls that are even cheaper...under $1...it's a great snack to take to work parties or potlucks!Great price, great food, great service.

I can never go in and buy just a fruit tart. I end up picking up tons of other goodies.My fiance and I buy the medium fruit tart and save it the fridge (takes up one whole shelf)...and have a slice a day for about a week. I wish I could have a slice everyday. Having moved to ORANGE from NoHo, I can only indulge when I come back to visit my parents.I know I dont have the credentials to say this, but \"POrto's is the best bakery ever\". I have yet to discover any other bakery that can even come close to Porto's, their own a league of their own. If you've still haven't been here. You better take the day off tomorrow and go. You'll wonder why you've never went earlier. Parking is hard most of the time, don't let it get to you. \u00a0If your going to go try the fruit tart, don't settle for the small one, they're good but not great like it's medium and large siblings. The small doesn't have custard and cake. The fruit tart is even MORE BETTER a day old. I would buy this for myself for every birthday, if I could.
