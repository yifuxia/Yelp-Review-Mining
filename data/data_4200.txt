The pastries are my favorite especially the fruit tart. There have so many different selections to choose from that you feel like a kid at a candy shop when you decide.

I would steer clear of the sandwiches though. We bought 3, the Cuban, pastrami, and Porto's veggie. The eggplant on the veggie was not peeled, so very tough and the eggplant itself was tough, I pulled it out and the rest of the veggies were great. No seasoning so slightly bland. The Cuban was OK, again no seasoning, just meat and bread. The pastrami my husband liked the best, because of the meat, very flavorful but again, just meat and bread, he added pickles when we got home.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Julianne H.", "time": "4/17/2013"}, {"content": "I love the sandwiches at this place they have a large variety from Pan Lechon, Ropa Vieja , Steak Torta , grilled chicken and my favorite Pan con bistec. when i want something sweet i cant go wrong with the refugiado pastry or there fruit tarts and there turnovers.

Aside from being crowded almost every time I've been, I've got to give Porto's props for their fair prices and excellent food and service.

If you've got a sweet tooth like me, you HAVE to try the carrot cake---it's amazing! Also, the potato balls are a great appetizer for your meal, and only 90 cents!
