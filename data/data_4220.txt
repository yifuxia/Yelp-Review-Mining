We loaded up on the usual sweet treats to take home. The Porto's Glendale location seems to be smaller.

My party got there at the height of lunch time. I thought it would've taken forever to pick up our food, but surprisingly it didn't take as long as I expected. They could've used some more wait staff to bring out the food for the dine in customers.
