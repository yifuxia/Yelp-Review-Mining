I'm addicted. Its destroying my body and I don't care. I've never had anything from here that wasn't amazingly delicious and surprisingly affordable. Everyone I've brought here loves it and me for showing it to them.A few favorites:-Breakfast Sandwiches: they have so much egg, its ridiculous. Panera can kiss Porto's greasy ass in the world of breakfast sammiches (and bread and pastries for that matter)-Potato Balls: You only need two to be full-Freshly squeezed OJ: oh my, so sweet, so refreshing. -Any pastry with fruit and cheese: Cheese rolls, Guava and cheese strudels... oh mamaAnother perk: no matter what kind of bizarre substitutions I want done to my sandwiches, they always get it right.Yeah, parking is a bitch... but it only weeds out the true lovers from the people that don't know any better.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lindsey K.", "time": "3/6/2009"}, {"content": "Love, love, LOVE!!! \u00a0I absolutely love bakeries and Porto's is no exception. \u00a0From the other reviews, it seemed like parking was one of the only issues compared to the Glendale location. \u00a0But I went bright and early on a Sunday morning and there were tons of street parking, so that wasn't a problem for me. \u00a0 My brother and sister in law were talking about Porto's desserts the last wknd I visited them and I always heard of Porto's but never got a chance to visit the place. \u00a0So I decided I'd stop by and pick up a few items from Porto's before I stopped by to visit them again.There was a slight line, but not too bad, as it was pretty fast since there were ton's of workers behind the counter taking orders. \u00a0It gave me a bit of time to decide what to pick b/c there were tons and tons of different pastries and desserts. \u00a0I tried to call my brother to see if he wanted anything specific but couldn't get a hold of him...so I decided just to pick out some random selections.I ended getting a Cuban sandwich, a tirimisu, red velvet cupcake, strawberry cupcake, the napoleon, mango cheesecake....My brother finally returned my call and I ended up getting back in line to pick out a few more items that he wanted....guava streusel, guava streusel w/ cheese, pineapple empanada, mango empanada, lemon cake.LOL, I finally made it out of there and realized I went a bit overboard and got way too much stuff.I didn't get to try everything but my favorite was the guava streusel...the red velvet cupcake was pretty good, pretty standard, had a bite of the lemon cake...it was a thin layer of cake on the bottom and all cream on top...the flavor was just right but I thought there was way too much cream. \u00a0I also had a bite of the napolean...flaky, creamy, and oh so delicious. \u00a0the pineapple empanada was pretty good too.The others I didn't get to really try, but I'm pretty sure my brother, sis in law and niece will/are enjoying it.oh and the Cuban sandwich was OK. \u00a0It honestly just tasted like a regular sandwich that I could've put together myself. \u00a0I wish the bread was more crispy/toasted.But all and all Porto's Bakery is definitely a thumbs up!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Di L.", "time": "9/20/2010"}, {"content": "Yummmmmmmmmy y potato ball!!!

They will definitely appreciate treats from this place. There is always, ALWAYS a line and there is a reason for that. It's totally worth it. And not a line like at Pink's Hot Dogs where you wait an hour and you get the hot dog and you are like..\"Hmm, it's good but not that good\".
