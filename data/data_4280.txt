I don't really have a sweet tooth and deserts/pastries aren't really for me but if I am ever in the neighborhood - I would definitely make time to go here just because of their cheese rolls and potato balls.The cheese rolls are classic. A dozen for $7.95 - very affordable. You take a bite of the most flaky, crispy but soft outer shell of the cheese roll, then you taste the tangy but sweet cheese filling. It's delectable. I could eat 5 in one sitting... and I don't eat that much, let alone eat something sweet. Potato balls! They're basically fried mashed potato balls with a kind of chill beef \u00a0filling. They are better if they're still warm. MMmmMm I just remembered how I felt when I took a bite out of my first potato ball HAHA! I can't wait to go back to SOCAL and get some more.This place is pretty popular but the line goes by quickly. Also, this location was pretty big and it seemed to be able to fit everyone. Most people get pastries to-go but they also have a sit down restaurant type of seating which is good. Parking wasn't too hard. They have a parking lot but you can find street parking if the lot is full - which it will most likely be.

I've never been disappointed with the quality of food and sweets here. Mostly famous for their Potato Balls, and Fruit Tarts, Empanadas, and even sandwiches. This place is freaking AMAZING. The sandwiches are served with a side of plantain chips that are sickly addictive. Though if you order a to go I don't think they give you the chips? (not sure it's been a while since I've been back) I prefer the Burbank location to the Glendale one, this one is bigger even though when it gets filled it feels just as small as the Glendale one.
