[{"content": "We were on our way back to San Francisco after visiting our son in Pomona when my wife asked if we could pass by Porto's. \u00a0She's been there and brought back some good grub. \u00a0So we went on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0Upon arrival, noticed that it was packed with customers, two lines even! \u00a0My wife assured me that we won't wait long. \u00a0So we commandeered an outside table. \u00a0My daughter and I waited in line and ordered the guava cheese strudel, chicken ceasar salad and the Cubana sandwich. \u00a0As expected, the strudel and sandwich were excellent. \u00a0The salad was surprisingly large and flavorful. \u00a0After reading the other reviews, I'm going to get the potato balls. \u00a0Gosh, that sounds soooo good right now!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Olet A.", "time": "10/17/2011"}, {"content": "I couldn't stop ordering....it is endless...and every sensory delight was satisfied. \u00a0The sad thing was they are so far away from us that we will have to plan a trip just to go. \u00a0Which we are already planning! \u00a0The whole experience is overwhelming....the old times bakery brought back to life. \u00a0The lines were crazy, but the wait went by quickly just trying to absorb the environment and the super intense menu. \u00a0Suprisingly, my hubby was all about the Hot Appetizers and few desserts I picked out. \u00a0We concur with the rest...the cheese rolls, potato balls, meat pie, and empanadas are true contenders. \u00a0Can't wait for the next trip back.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Michelle H.", "time": "6/27/2012"}, {"content": "Good, decent food, somewhat overpriced on certain items. \u00a0Almost like a high school lunch cafeteria setup except that the food is better. \u00a0This place is very loud, so studying, reading, writing, or having meetings are not good.

Coming here is my equivalent of Disneyland..I am giddy and happy. And what was that?! They have mushroom soup today!??So here is what you do: order items from the deli - the pork tamale, chorizo pie, potato balls and meat pies (because they give it to you right away). Then as you are waiting for your awesome smoothie (preferably mango) to be made, eat the deli items you just bought. \u00a0Work off some calories by walking over to the pick up counter to get your soup and sandwich. Now find a table. \u00a0Once you are done with you meal, come back, stand in line and get your desserts. Trust me, you will need time to figure out which dessert is worth it to squeeze down in between the cubano sandwich and the 5 potato balls you just ate. \u00a0Red velvet cupcake? Check. Guava pastry? Check.Oh and if you are wondering why everyone is talking about potato balls? It's filled with o-m-g-to-die-for meat in the middle. The food here can definitely clog your arteries, but you know what?

She also brought home some sweets like expresso creme, tiramisu, berry trifle and creme brulee... all of which were excellent! We recently came by as a pit stop and the whole place was packed! Seems like a regular thing, usually a good indicator of yumminess! We got into the bakery line, which moved pretty fast. It was a double loop, and near the last part you can stare at the large glass cases full of pastries, desserts and savories. Based on yelp, I ordered the top three reviewed items which were the potato ball, the meat pie and the cheese rolls. I can totally see why the potato ball was in the most reviews- the filling was really tasty! My husband preferred it with a little tabasco tho. The meat pie was ok- nice flaky crust but with it being slightly sweet it didn't really match with the savory filling. Next up, the cheese rolls... omg, so good! I kinda wished I ordered an extra dozen, but my waistline is saying, nah that's ok... maybe next time!I also ordered a cubano and hot pastrami sandwich, both of which were tasty but maybe would have been even better fresh. I ate one half on the road, and the bread was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside... but after being in the fridge, it tasted like a plain deli sandwich. Would like to try the plantain chips next time too.Oh yah, I got a red velvet cupcake, and the frosting was not overwhelming (ahem, Sprinkles)... just the right amount and sweetness to compliment the cupcake that was somewhat dry (but it could have been that way because I put it straight into the fridge after a long drive back to NorCal).
