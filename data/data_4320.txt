Ah heck, what the hell. Let's add another, shall we?I'll keep it short and sweet and I'll try to cook up some new editorial for you inquisitive readers out there. (Is it just me, or is it *yawn* to read the same review from 50 different perspectives?) First of all just know that Porto's has been open for a looooong time and I just recently stepped foot inside. Their lines are el terrible' but I thought I'd try it out and find out for myself what all the hype is about.Their pastry and dessert cases are so beautiful. It's like the Willy Wonka of pastry and desserts. Their dulce de leche latte gives my usual Starbucks caramel macchiato a run for its money. I liked it so much I had to order it consecutively for the two days I managed to muster up reasons to be at Hollywood Way and Magnolia.5 stars alone to the staff who are quick, efficient, friendly, and smiley. They also ask to see your ID when you pay with your debit card, which is something I can appreciate.
