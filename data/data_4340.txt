Expect a long line but it'll be your turn before you even figure out what to order, so go prepared, check online what pastries, cakes, strudels, breads that you want and make a list. Otherwise, you'll find chaos standing at the counter and not knowing what to get. I go for the cheese rolls, guava rolls, apple/mango turnovers, and the strudels. They're all good, best on the first day, and as you drive home, the smell will make your mouth water. Parking is hard here even though they have a small private lot; be careful in parking on the residential streets - read the signs. Buy a box for a potluck, as a gift, or just dessert.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Calvin Y.", "time": "12/23/2010"}, {"content": "This place wasn't even on my radar til just a couple of weeks ago. A friend tweeted about it but I was like, eh so what, it's all the way in friggin' BURBANK--when am I ever going to be in Burbank?! But wouldn't you know it, I ended up attending an event at a yarn store down the street from it so I saw it as a golden opportunity to give this much-lauded place a try. Well it turned out to be a stellar experience for me. First of all, I was bracing myself for some crazy crowds, but it wasn't bad at all at 6:15 on a Thursday night. Only about 10 people in front of me at the sandwich line and it does move fast. I wasn't in the mood for sweets so I just opted for a Medianoche Preparada sandwich and a black coffee for a small dinner. That was a damn good sandwich, with layers of thinly sliced ham, pork, and cheese on an eggy croissant-ish bread. Their butter/mustard spread just brings the whole sandwich together and it was wonderful! The \"preparada\" is the addition of croquetas to their regular Medianoche sandwich. I thought they'd be on the side or something, but instead they were inside the sandwich, which was perfectly fine. The croquetas are wonderfully crispy on the outside and filled with creamy potato puree with bits of ham (?). Absolutely delicious. The side of thin crispy plaintain chips were the perfect accompaniment to the sandwich, and their regular coffee was strong and wonderful. I was toying with the idea of getting some bakery stuff to go, but since they'd be sitting in my car for a few hours I wasn't sure how they were going to do. So I didn't get to sample any of the pastries, but I'm sure they must be as fantastic as everyone says, in light of my sandwich experience.What pushed this place up to 5 stars for me was everything else in addition to the great food. First there was the great service. Starting with the friendly cashier and the beverage guy to the bus boy who cleaned off my table cheerfully just set the right tone for this amazingly efficient operation. Second was the cleanliness and inviting atmosphere. Considering the amount of people that pass through this place everyday it was very clean (including the bathroom). The only bummer is that it's so far away from me, but I hear a location in Downey will be opening up sometime this year, hooray!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Steph H.", "time": "1/8/2010"}, {"content": "There is a reason why people wake up in the mornings... For PORTOS! This place is bananas in the morning as people line up both lines for their day's fix of pastry and confection goodness. I love them most for their Cheese Rolls. This simple yet delightful pastry is topped with sugar crystals and stuffed with the right amount of sweet cheese. The pastry crust is soft yet flaky for a satisfying bite. I usually like to leave it in the refrigerator for a bit and eat it cold - something about the temperature accentuates the goodness to the 3rd power. Did I mention this delicious pastry is only $0.65? On the weekend, you can get a pre-packaged dozen at a discounted price (which is even crazier because all their prices are so affordable and well, cheap). They also have so many other things! Potato balls (stuffed with meat!). Pulled Pork, Shredded Beef, and other Cuban-inspired sandwiches. Sweet & savory Croissants. Juices. Lattes & Coffee. Cake slices and gigantic cakes (their fruit tarts are tasty - really good custard to fruit to crust ratio). I always come intending to just get cheese rolls, but I always manage to leave with just a few more... I'll be honest, there's nothing else I love as much as the cheese rolls, but I don't mind trying until I change my opinion!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Jenny C.", "time": "2/15/2010"}, {"content": "I don't really know what more I can say about this place that hasn't already been said.

Porto's is the place to go for casual, delicious Cuban food. They have delicious sandwich options with fried plantains, beautiful desserts that look too good to eat (if you really don't have the heart to eat it, just give it to me), and best of all.. fried empanadas, croquette, etc. Not only is the food delicious, but everyone is also nice. Southern California has recently experienced something called... rain (I think that's what it's called..) and we've all had to bust out with our dusty umbrellas. As soon as I walked in, an employee immediately rushed to me with a bag that I could put my wet umbrella in. Awesome. Also, when I dropped my potato ball (*cue sad music*) while rushing to the table to devour it, they gave me another one to replace the one on the floor.

So anytime there would be birthdays we had a cake ordered in advance and picked up. We tried to make it a point to try all the cakes on their menu! I think during our busiest birthday season I was there 4 times in one week! The cake that is always a hit is the triple chocolate mousse cake...it looks like a work of art with the ribbons of white chocolate on top and tastes twice as amazing! I don't think i can continue writing in fear that my stomach will yell at me...in short the must have items are: cheese rolls, potato balls & triple chocolate mousse cake (just leave your diet out the door)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Joy C.", "time": "6/7/2010"}, {"content": "Love their potato balls and tres leches", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jody W.", "time": "11/11/2011"}, {"content": "I love this place so much I moved 2 blocks away from it!

How can something SOOOOOO delicious be so cheap. I use to live in Burbank and would stop by here about once a week and pick up a dozen cheese rolls for work.
