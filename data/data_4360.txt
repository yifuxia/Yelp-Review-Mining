Ever since I moved to Glendale, I wanted to find a good and inexpensive cafe to visit on the weekends for light lunches. Boy, was I surprised when I stumbled into Portos! I love their sandwiches and pastries! Not only are they made FRESH, their prices aren't too bad either. The potato balls and the guava & cheese refugios are a must every time I go! They have so many treats to choose from, I always feel like a little kid at candy store! I don't know why people are so critical and give this place 3 or 4 stars. This is by far one of the best cafe/bakeries in the area.

I came here for breakfast. It's my 2nd time at Porto's. The breakfast is very simple yet so delicious! We ordered the Cheese Omelette Sandwich on the croissant. The Croissant is so buttery and delicious! Honestly, what made it so delicious was the croissant! We also had the Chorizo & Egg Omelette Sandwich. This was pretty good too but both of us agreed that the Croissant Sandwich was better! Of course we ordered a whole bunch of potato balls and guava pastries to go. This place never disappoints. I also had the pumpkin spice latte. I'm used to having my latte overpowered with the pumpkin spice flavor but they are very subtle with it.

I got the Cubano sandwich, it was ok. The pork taste was a bit overwhelming for me, but that's just me. My friend got the steak sandwich and i liked hers better.

But much to my surprise (I was really shocked), everything I ordered was under $25 dollars. \u00a0*** At this point in the review - if you are the owner - please put on your \"eye muffs\" *** That's right - Not only is the food amazing, but it is DIRT CHEAP!!! \u00a0This combination does not come along all to often... Thank god this place is not near my house, because I would definitely be fatter than I already am... Onto the food. \u00a0Because I pretty much liked everything, I am just going to say that you should go for any pastry with Guava in it and definitely get yourself a Potato Ball.
