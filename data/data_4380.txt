[{"content": "What is there not to love about Portos? Unbeatable prices, delicious food and drinks, and quick & friendly service. The only sandwich I've ever eaten here is the cubano, which just by itself I would give probably 4 or 5 stars for. But this place is better known for their cheese rolls and potato balls, which are a must if you go. I also get the horchata smoothie every time I come here, and I don't even like horchata that much.The cheese rolls are great to take to go, and I guarantee you that if you take a box of these to work your coworkers will love you. The potato balls are probably best enjoyed when they're fresh though, so i'd recommend eating these right away after you get them. They also do a very nice job with their cakes here, so if you're celebrating a birthday or a special occasion this would be an excellent place to pick up a cake. It seems like this location isn't quite as busy as the Glendale location, but maybe it's just because the layout is a little simpler so it seems more organized at the Burbank one.

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is it way too small. BUT it is only too small because the place is always packed, the parking is in the back which is a guaranteed nightmare, you'd be lucky to find a spot. However, there is parking up and down Magnolia and the side streets specifically for the strip and it's FREE. One of the best things about Burbank is all the free public parking. The restaurant itself is a pretty good size, but again because the place is so freakin good and popular the lines and sitting area can be a insane. DEFINITELY worth it though. However, they have so many workers that the lines move quickly so don't be daunted by the sight, it won't take long and besides, anything that has a line that long MUST be good. Also, they have two lines, one for the deli the other for the Bakery alone, so that too helps, they also have a cake only line, so yeah pretty efficient. Their potato balls are the shit. Sorry, no other word to describe them. A must have. Also some cheese danish thing that I am sure has already been mentioned in a previous review. I've only had their carne asade torta from the deli but let me tell you, amazing. It was fairly large and super fresh.

Granted, I've only tried a couple things, but from what I have had, I don't think it's worth the hassle of driving out to Glendale and waiting in the excessive lines.Contrary to other's experiences, I have not had trouble finding parking spaces. Usually I immediately find parking in the back lot or on the street in front. It costs money but it's a very reasonable $1 an hour. The lines are a bit excessive. I've been on both a weekend and a weekday, and it doesn't seem to do anything to the length of the line. It's always long. The line does seem to move pretty fast though. I do like it how there is someone in line who takes your order so you can just hand it to the cashier when you get to the front of the line. I'm sure it speeds up the process a whole lot too. Unlike other places, they give you a number so that they can bring you the food rather than you having to stand around and wait for it. Once you get out of line, you have to wait for an table to open up because all of them will guaranteed be filled. It's a little bit Social Darwinist because it doesn't matter who was waiting first. The first person to the table gets the table. It's as simple as that. Usually I like to have someone look for a table while I'm in line getting the order. As for the food, don't get the steak sandwich or the plantain chips. They are bland and flavorless. The steak tastes like they got it out of a beef jerky bad. If you are going to get a sandwich, get the Cubano. It's good but still merely average. The only two things I would really recommend are the potato balls and the guava smoothie. Both are excellent.
