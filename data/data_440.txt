Yes, to everything about this place. The service is great and there are people at the door to direct you and help you out if you have questions. The customer service here is great and it goes hand in hand with the food. The first time I ordered the potato balls, cheese rolls, dulce de leche cookie, and a horchata smoothie (it was not all for me, although I did consider not sharing lol). I can here in Friday, October 16, 2015. The cheese rolls were my favorite, although the potato balls were good. The horchata smoothie was really good. I can here for a second time that Sunday, October 18. I got the same items, with the exception of the smoothie, which I chose the pi\u00f1a colada flavor & a spinach feta croissant. All the items I chose were delicious. You have to come here, if you are in the area. Great service & good food.

Man, they weren't kidding about the lines. Even though it was slammed we ordered and got seated within 15 minutes which was pretty impressive. We ordered a ton of stuff and nothing was really memorable except for the cheesy potato ball which I thought was pretty good. I got a Caprese sandwich and it was okay. Also got a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake that I thought was decent. I think it's definitely a bit of a tourist spot. While the food is okay and relatively cheap, I don't see the hype behind it. I certainly wouldn't wait a long time in line for it.

The pastries!! We had the guava strudel and I am blown away!!! \u00a0I've had the actual fruit and this tasted just like it!!!
