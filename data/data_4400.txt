You could literally try a little bit of everything. This is also a curse, my pants start expanding even before I get in the front door of this place. The downside is that the parking lot gets super packed during peak times, and it can also be hard to find a table when it's busy. The noise level gets a little high too, which can make it difficult to have a conversation with someone.

When I used to work in Burbank, I passed by this place a few times and it was always packed. The potato balls are good (even though I think they're overrated), but all the desserts I had \u00a0from there were the bomb. I've never been inside, I've only had people bring the stuff to work.

Coming from Miami where excellent Cuban Cafe's are a dime a dozen I can say that I have been following Porto's for years. This is a great place. Family friendly and good for breakfast, lunch or a coffee. Their gourmet cakes are beautiful both to look at and to eat. Try a cafe con leche with a couple of papas rellenas and you are in heaven!

While I cannot judge this place on decor, staff and customer service, on thing stands apart....these cheese rolls are to die for. Brought here by the extended Cali family, they were more than a pasalubong (aka filipino gift), they were the epitome of what real bakeries are made of. Its my quest to find the best of THE BEST nationwideThese simple croissant like Cuban pastries are flakey, airy and light AND (YES AND) have a filling like no other. I tried the ones with a cream cheese filling and the guava filling. The cream cheese was fabulous, not too sweet, not too light with almost a whipped cream texture. Wow! \u00a0The guava was good. \u00a0Fruity with a tad bit tartness. Which of you Chicago Yelpers are going to southern Cali?! Bring me back some pasalubong from this place!!!!

Luckily the place is large enough to fit you, your family, your extended family, your friends and your friend's family. If you live in LA it means that you've been here before and you've tried the potato balls, meat pie, cheese rolls and chicken empanadas. After that you've taken them home to eat at 2am while watching Adult Swim and you probablly had the rest for breakfast in the morning. Even if you don't remember ever going, you did.

I have tried a bunch of them over the years and they are all delicious!Their round cakes are about $25 and will feed a big group of people. My favorite is probably the tiramisu. I have also tried and liked the Parisian chocolate (VERY chocolatey & rich, you only need a small slice), Triple Chocolate Mousse (!!), some sort of espresso chocolate cake was good too. It's always very crowded so it is a good idea to pre-order the cakes you want, then you won't have to wait in line. They put an inscription on the cake when you come to pick it up, usually on a sepeate piece of white chocolate. I haven't had any bad experiences here. One time a Parisian cake I had bought sort of collapsed in the box, but that could have been my fault - who knows. It tasted just as good so it is ok.Oh I forgot to mention when I first wrote this, but their pastries, muffins, \u00a0cookies, etc are all very delicious as well!
