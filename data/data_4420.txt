They are a very serious operation. Always busy, but the food still came out quickly. We tried the potato ball things, the croquettes, and the medianoche sandwich.

Buttered bread, perfect ham, pork, cheese, mustard, and pickle filling, So good. The ONLY reason I knocked off a star is cuz I was in Miami last year and tasted the best of the best.

That was so GOOD\".. Ugh...had I not gone to this place I would have gone through life and never known what the \"perfect bakery\" was.With the awesome assistance of one woman Liz (oh Liz, you are the sales lady of the century) who not only showed me what to buy and what they're known for but let me have whole entire FREE samples of everything just to prove to me how good it was, I had a box full of danishes, cookies, potato balls and meat pies which were ALL delicious. I'm sure they do that often, but I do recommend the lost puppy look...might get you more!I know this is the longest review known to man, but one more thing to add is the price. It's so cheap/affordable which makes this place even better!
