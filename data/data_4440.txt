I have only been here 3 times, but I'm glad that I live far away, or else I'd be obese and broke without a doubt. I haven't sampled much of their sweets, but their savory items alone are to die for. Potato balls, chicken croquettes (YES), meat pies, chicken empanadas, tamales, chorizo pies, just to name a few. I've also had their cheese rolls, spinach feta croissants (oh my God), and cheese guava rolls as well. Though mainly a bakery, they also have a good selection of entrees, notably their sandwiches. I'd much rather choose a $4.25 medianoche sandwich (comes with plantain chips!) over a $5 footlong at Subway. It is very reasonably priced, filling, and something worth trying. They have free customer parking in the back and if the lots are full, try your luck with the street parking. There are 2 lines for your convenience and the sake of brevity, and there is a good amount of seating.

You're sweet, you're spontaneous, and you know where all my weak spots are. You give me everything I want and need, and you always leave me asking for more. Where do I begin expressing my longing desire for you...The first time we met I was ordering a cake for my mom's birthday. I got the cappucino mousse and she absolutely loved it. You have this spell over people...The mousse was whipped to perfection, creamy but oh so light, and smacking exactly of cappucino. But I knew this wouldn't be a one night stand, I was too in love with you from the start. The second time around I wanted you even more. I was going to my friend's brunch, and ordered a small selection of your pastries. The chocolate croissant was bliss. Flakey, buttery, just enough chocolate oozing out of the side...this is how your lips must feel. The cheese balls were heavenly as well. Flakey crust on the outside, sweet cheese on the inside. And you love Jews! The egg challah bread was so fresh! \u00a0Even my religious father will approve of you!Porto's, there is no other bakery like you. I know it. You're heartbreakingly delicious, you're cheap as hell, and you have all my favorites. I just wish you wern't such a slut...your lines are always so big! But that is something I have to accept.
