So as I was called up to be helped, I actually got a really nice server who was patient with me as I backed up from the glass display to get a better view of the array of pastries. \u00a0I ended up getting the guava rolls, cheese rolls, polvorones, cuban sandwiches, and a mango smoothie. \u00a0I waited longer for my sandwiches than I did waiting to place my order. Everything was to go so we jetted outta there.I couldn't resist and tried a potato ball in the parking lot. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0It was nice and warm and crunchy as you bite into it. \u00a0Then it becomes soft like mashed potatoes with the minced meat. \u00a0It wasn't what I imagined it to be. \u00a0If I wasn't full from lunch, I would've ate another one. \u00a0My mango smoothie was nice. \u00a0It tasted really fresh! \u00a0Once we got back home, we ate our Cuban sandwiches. \u00a0Personally, I've had a better Cuban, but then again, I ate it like 6 hours later. \u00a0I also tried the guava roll, cheese roll and polvorones. They were all delicious although I liked the cheese roll and polvorones the best. \u00a0We have a friend that went to SoCal this weekend and we placed an order for Porto's. \u00a0Can't wait to bite into another potato ball tomorrow!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "beverly r.", "time": "1/16/2012"}, {"content": "So much love for Porto's.At this location, I've gotten the Cuban sandwich, think it was the Pan con Bistec sandwich (one of the steak ones, sorry), meat pie, potato balls, and Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I've tried more from the Glendale location, though.I just can't gush enough about Porto's. Prices are fair, portions are right, and hot foods are served hot!
