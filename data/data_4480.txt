I MISS IT SO MUCH!! Boston should take a lesson from the amazing quality of food offerings and low prices. The potato balls are like round morsels of heaven. The meat pies are delicious! The egg sandwich with avocado so yummy! The homemade, fresh squeezed OJ outstanding! We tried a couple of the desserts and loved those too! The cuban sandwich was one of the best I have ever had and it was under $4. The service is fast and well organized. It's well worth the wait if there is a line. It moves fast and they give you a table number card if you are eating there. I will be dreaming of our next trip to California. I will see you again Porto's!!!

Their sweets are to die for and their cafe sandwiches are heaven. My entire family loves this place. We have used it for birthday's, graduations, snack attacks, etc. And now, I am about to get married and we have purchased my wedding cake from Portos along with other 'antojitos' (Bites) for the cocktail hour. My maid of honor (who had never been here) and my matron of honor (who fell in love with it when I introduced it to her 2 years ago) both screamed with joy when we went cake testing *LOL* I thought it said a lot, because they where both speechless and happy. If anyone is ever near the Glendale or Burbank Porto's I HIGHLY recommend you stop by. The lines are long, parking might be a challenge, but the second you taste their goodies it will alll be well worth it.
