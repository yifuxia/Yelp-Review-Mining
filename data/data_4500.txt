Reason being, to keep me from visiting Porto's in Burbank on the DAILY. It was my very first time yesterday stopping by this place. I love how its HUGE! I was on the way to the airport to drop off my sister. We had time to kill so we decided to explore this Porto's goodness. I got 2 Dulce de Leche Kisses and 1 Cheese Roll. By the time we left the bakery, I consumed all 3 crack goods in my stomach. I never even had it before and after my first time, I ate it all under 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES! Are you kidding me? Thank God, I am not diabetic. Dont be too intimidated by the line, it goes by QUICK!

Potato Balls and Meat pies are pretty amazing and extremely affordable. Also, their chocolate covered strawberries are amazing and i think about $2, Godiva quality without the Godiva price.

My friend got an entire box of delicious pastries for $5 and I, accidentally on purpose, ate the whole box! I dont even like sweets but their pastries are excellent. Not too sweet and the butter is perfectly cooked in so I don't have to feel as guilty about eating it. It's also really cheap! It was less \u00a0than a dollar I think for most pastries, compared to Santa Barbara where you have to pay $5 for one pastry.I probably ate about 5 potato balls too so be sure to get those! So so tasty--fried mashed potato goodness with a juicy meaty filler. (i guess you can tell that I'm suffering from Porto's withdrawal) My friend who is Cuban also said that they were better than his grandma's, which I would imagine to be a big feat to accomplishThis place is probably the last place you would want to be while hungover because it is extremely crowded on a Sunday morning and there are screaming babies and angry hungry people.

I've had things there before including the chicken croquettes and the feta cheese sandwich. \u00a0Chicken croquettes are crisp, fresh and super hot. \u00a0Bite sized (actually 3 bite) morsels of chicken gooieness that can be a meal in itself. \u00a0And the feta cheese sandwich? \u00a0UM, GREAT. \u00a0Yah, don't get me wrong, I've done the Cuban Sandwich there too which is good of course, but I wanted to do something different and that dang bread had good bite with chewy inside and the tomatoes? \u00a0Perfectly sliced - not too thin, not to thick with a generous portion of a feta slab. \u00a0Just divine!But can't say the word divine without diving into those potato balls. \u00a0They are warm, mushy, perfectly round, with a the special surprise of ground meat. \u00a0It's not that there is some super duper spice to these things - it's just comforting as the potatoes and crust swirl around the mouth. \u00a0And of course there is a world of desserts to try there! \u00a0I'll get into that next time.As for the lines - they move fast. \u00a0Service is good. \u00a0Go early or go late and you'll be able to find parking.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Kristin A.", "time": "9/28/2009"}, {"content": "I have never tasted anything quite like the pastries at Porto's Bakery. I was expecting to come to a hole in the wall place when I heard of the famous Porto's, but I was very wrong. Me and my boyfriend pulled up around the corner to find parking in front a very large bakery offering a very HUGE variety of pastries, treats, cakes, sandwiches and more.I have tried the guava cheese strudels which is the same pastry I must get every time I travel down to SoCal. It is a MUST TRY. They sell it by the dozen SO CHEAP that you are tempted to take dozenS home! I have also tried the cheese roll which is my second favorite! YUMM! I never knew sweet cheese could be so addicting. Then I tries a bite of the mango turnover which I didn't like at all. And the meat pie was decent. Reminded me of a Vietnamese meat pie that, in my opinion, tastes better. I have never had lunch here, but it's on my list of things to do. Every time I see a plate come out with a sandwich and those chips that look house made I wished that I ordered a sandwich. However I have tried their smoothies. My favorite would be the guava smoothie which is on the pricer side and then I tried the mango smoothie which was just decent. I would tr more when I come back. You can't really go wrong with anything you try at Porto's!Parking is pretty easy even on a crowded day. There is a parking lot behind the bakery, but it has limited spots so you might just have to park on the streets. The parking is two hours max, but who would really stay at a bakery for two hours? Well actually I could see the possibility. Anyway, parking shouldn't be an issue and if it is then it is well worth it. TRUST ME.The staff are all REALLY nice. I'm surprised how they aren't grumpy with the amount of traffic that comes through the baker. There is a greeter at the door that hands you a paper menu if you need a better look. She also asks you if you're a first timer and is glad to help you with anything. GREAT customer service. This place should be on the things you must eat before you die. It is THAT good.
