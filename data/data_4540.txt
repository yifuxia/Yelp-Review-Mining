The place looks like an overgrown Panera Bread with lines out the door (and in some instances, swinging around the corner). However, consuming those awesome cheese rolls is like, well, in one word: heaven. If heaven had to have a dessert of choice and if God wasn't lactose intolerant, I think they would be at the top of the list. It's soo good. Living in San Diego, I don't get to indulge in Portos that often...but the last time I went I bought a dozen to bring back home. I probably ate half on the way back though...Be prepared to find street parking and to wait in line with lots of hungry people around you, because it's going to happen.

This place is awesome. I know this bakery since 1998. This was when the bakery was only known for the cheese rolls. Cheese rolls were less than 1 dollar. This place has amazing finger foods such as cheese rolls, croquet, and the guava cheese rolls.Everytime I'd go to this place, calling 2 of my friends are a must. Also when they go to Porto's, calling us is a given ^_^ ..!!, We have a mutual understanding to call each other (because this bakery is so damn far from Orange County).I wish they'd make another store in Orange County.

I seriously wanted everything, it all looked so delicious... It didn't help that it was 6pm and I hadn't eaten the entire day.As I was picking out the delicious goodies I wanted, I couldn't help but ask about the guava cheese roll since it sounded interesting. I only asked the girl helping me how they were and she ended up giving me an entire piece as a sample. I was surprised and confused, but I still ate it. It was so delicious. The pastry was nice and buttery but not too buttery. The guava taste was relatively mild and not overwhelming. I also had the cheese roll, spinach and feta croissant, and mango mousse cake. All of which were amazing! Not only is it amazing, it is also pretty cheap! A lot of their things, like the potato balls and cheese rolls are under a dollar.The only thing I didn't love was the smoothie I ordered. I had a mango smoothie, it was a little too sweet for me.

I dont know what happened but consistency is key for business. I don't want to buy a whole dozen of pastries, salivate in the car, finally grab one at home and realize its not the same guava pastry i was looking forward to. The most recent guava filling had too strong of an artificial lemony-lime taste. The most recent cheese rolls were not the same as the ones before at all, salty and meager on the cheese filling! Also, i got the fruit tart twice in a month and the first one was GOOD with an equal balance of cream and cake and tart crust but the second one was imbalanced.

After reading yelp reviews we decided to try the Cubano. The sandwich was perfectly warm--not hot enough to burn your mouth but warm enough to stay so the whole meal! How perfect is that? The bread was amazing--it had a perfectly crusty outside while not being hard and also having a soft inside. The flavors were well balanced and delicious. The plantain chips added a nice dimension of texture and beautiful color but that's about it. The chips were stale and flavorless, which was disappointing because plantain chips should have a wonderful flavor.*****Also, I'm really not a fan of the coffee here. I got an iced mocha and my friend the iced coffee. Both simply tasted like chocolate milk--way too sweet for me, not enough espresso and just too overpowered with cream. Maybe some people prefer this creamy, overly sweet excuse for coffee but not me.*We also asked about the potato balls because of the raving reviews. They actually gave each of us one free sample, which was a great way to try it without having to commit... I wasn't a big fan (I didn't know what to expect of it--I don't like greasy, I don't even like potato, and it was really heavy for that small little thing). If you wanna try it because of the reviews, but like me don't know what it is, ask for the free sample.**If it was just the sandwich I would have given a five star rating though.

With the high volume of customers they have it almost makes it an inconvenience to drive.

Despite all the great reviews and recommendations by a few of my friends. So I'm going to keep it short and honest... lines go fairly fast even if its long so decide fast, roast pork sandwich was bland (until we asked for sauce) which brought it to okay. When you order, you will need to yell at them and even though they remember to charge you for everything you ordered that doesn't necessarily mean it will all make it inside the boxes. They charged me for things they ran out of, and if you call to complain it'll take more then 3 calls, one to leave a message, one to ale sure they didn't forget you, another one to see if the manager will actually try to get a response It will take about two days to do so. So with that being said I received 10 items out of the 19 items on the receipt: \u00a03 which they were out of and the other items never made it so check the items before you leave. I even asked them twice is this everything. \u00a0Here is the good..guava smoothie, guava pastry and the potato balls/ cheese balls.
