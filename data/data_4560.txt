[{"content": "whoever started Porto's Bakery... i owe you much gratitude, as you consistently add a multitude of joy to my life. potato balls, cheese rolls, napoleons, and cuban sandwiches. SO FREAKIN GOOD. and affordable. every time i go, i always cringe as the cashier rings up my large order of pastries, thinking that i'm going to have to cough up bills to pay for everything. but i'm always surprised at how affordable everything is! I think the cheese rolls are 75 cents each and the potato balls are 90 cents each. \u00a0totally worth the small price tag and i can order them in bulk! i go home, add a little tabasco sauce onto my potato ball, and fork the shizzle out of it.my only gripe about this place, which surely isn't a gripe for the owners, is how busy the bakery is ALL THE TIME. even in the middle of the day, the lines are always long. i thought i was the only one who was unemployed and had nowhere to go at 2:30pm. \u00a0according to Porto's, there are A LOT of people in my shoes. but the wait is really a small price to pay for how good the food is. \u00a0i absolutely love love love this place!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lena K.", "time": "8/10/2012"}, {"content": "Amazing pastries, great sandwiches and super long lines. \u00a0Went to one while I was visiting LA. \u00a0I wish there was one where I lived.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Ali K.", "time": "1/28/2013"}, {"content": "I always get my cakes from here.

They were all good but the cheese roll definitely tasted better when heat up.They have two lines and they moved pretty quickly but even if they didn't it was okay because you needed the time to look around anyways.Overall, good prices and quality.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Queenie M.", "time": "8/10/2010"}, {"content": "3 words come to mind when I think of my Porto's experience. \u00a0Oh. My. God.It all started out on a quiet Friday afternoon when I went to visit a good friend, and one of my favorite partners in crime in the food department, in LA. \u00a0We were originally going to get sushi, but upon adding Ikea to our list of errands for the day, my friend vetoed sushi and said that we HAD to go to Porto's, which was nearby, describing \"potato puffs filled with meat\" that were to die for. \u00a0I'm not going to lie, I was a little disgusted since let's not kid ourselves, that doesn't sound at all appetizing, but, as I generally trust her taste in food, I went along with it... \u00a0What ensued was 1 hour of unadulterated foodie bliss. \u00a0Porto's is a decent-sized bakery with a fairly large parking lot, but it was near impossible for us to find a spot, since hordes of people kept arriving. \u00a0That should have been my tip-off. Since my friend had been raving about the potato puffs, which are mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef and then battered and fried, I decided to try one. \u00a0We also shared a pastry puff filled with feta and spinach, and we got turkey croissant sandwiches. \u00a0Bye bye girlie figure, hello flavor country! \u00a0Everything we had was amazing! \u00a0It was the kind of amazing where you stop talking and say, you guessed it, oh. my. god. \u00a0The potato puff was truly delicious. \u00a0The beef was perfectly seasoned and not at all overpowered by the mashed potatoes. \u00a0The feta and spinach pastry was pure bliss as well. \u00a0The crust was flaky and buttery and the filling was the perfect blend of spinach and cheese. \u00a0The croissan-wich was also delicious (though in all fairness, a croissan-wich would be fairly difficult to mess up). \u00a0The best part? \u00a0Porto's is RIDICULOUSLY cheap! \u00a0My entire meal came out to $5.10, and I was absolutely stuffed! \u00a0Should I find myself in Burbank any time in the future, I will be sure to loosen my belt and head straight for Porto's!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Julie S.", "time": "9/25/2009"}, {"content": "Guava and Cheese Rolls were amazing!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Donovan R.", "time": "9/24/2012"}, {"content": "with over 2000 reviews i think that pretty much speaks for itself. i have an account up here which is why i always go to this one. its probably the furthest from my house. i always seem to get the same things which are the cuban sandwich for now and potato balls and cheese rolls for later. The guava cheese rolls are also very good. i've tried a few of their cakes like milk and berries and tres leches which are also excellent.parking at this location is a bit crowded in the lot but theres plenty of street parking which i just go straight for.

Where things tend to break down is the occasional misinterpreted order, or lengthy wait for delivery of the order to your table. Otherwise, it's all good. Catering reveals both their efficiency and lack of personal relationship with the customer. Twice now I have pre-paid at least a week in advance, only to arrive on pick-up day to discover that a crucial part of the order was unavailable. Why let me purchase and pay for something when you cannot guarantee it's availability? At least warn me of the possibility of being unable to fulfill this order for which I am paying a full week in advance!Recently, I've also been finding the savory pastries getting a little dry, but this small step-down from the heights of deliciousness they previously sat at makes them merely fantastic, as opposed to previously divine.If the chaos, delays, and inability to fulfill pre-paid orders were fixed, these guys would have 5 stars from me.UPDATE 01/02/2014 - Having come here, on average, once a month for the past few years, I have been noticing a decline in quality of food. I thought it might be a one-of experience, but the last three visits have shown that this is a trend. Pity. The service remains excellent, the organization has become a little better, but the food is suffering.UPDATE 04/30/2016 - THings have turned around! I guess increased media exposure and some positive votes has encouraged the Porto family to up their game, and the food has demonstrated a noticeable increase in quality, of late.

I also got a spinach feta croissant, flaky and delish!Price: DAMN CHEAP! All of the above, with the exception of the spinach croissant was under $1!
