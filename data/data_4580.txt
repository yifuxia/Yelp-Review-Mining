This place is pretty busy, but there is plenty of seating! There is a large selection of cakes and pastries to chose from.

I had an orgasm in my mouth! It is THAT AMAZING.Parisian chocolate cake- Wooaaahh this is for all chocolate lovers! Intense!! Four layers of chocolate cake and whipped chocolate mousse.. mmmmm!!!!It's a good thing Portos is 30 miles away from me, or it would for sure sabotage my abs hahaha.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Shani V.", "time": "9/13/2010"}, {"content": "Porto's makes one of the best tasting (and affordable) pastries, one bite of their innocent looking cheese roll and you'll be addicted for life! And if you think the cheese roll can't get any better, indulge in the guava and cheese-filled roll, this takes things further up a notch. Their breakfast menu is also equally good, but their potato balls and fried plantains are the standouts.

You make my friends come from far away just so we can have lunch together at, hopefully, a table in your restaurant. You have brought my friends and I back together. You have brought me together with sugar. And you have brought me together with pork. And when I get home from a Porto's outing, my boyfriend doesn't greet me because he's happy to see me, he's in search of a Porto's box, hoping there's some sweet goodies in it. And if he's lucky then I have gotten my fill while at Porto's, but on those rare occasions I end up bringing half eaten goodies for him because the car ride home from Porto's is at least 20 minutes and that's just too long for me to be alone with that little Porto's box. For you first timers: Plan ahead if you're going on a weekend. Bring a buddy and have one person stand in line for the order and another person scout out seating. When you first enter Porto's you can get a paper menu from the front and text your buddy what you want. Seating is a PITA, but Porto's tastes just as good while sitting outside in a planter or on the sidewalk blocking traffic. Porto's tastes good anywhere you eat it. My favs: RED VELVET CAKE!! Tiramisu, tres leches cake, anything in that glass case really. Potato balls! You have to try this. It's a fried mashed potato ball stuffed with meat. Get some to go as well, you'll regret not doing so when you're done with your meal and going \"man I shoulda got more of those to go!\" and you consider standing in that long line again just for 2 potato balls to go.
