The last time she brought them, I had to physically move them into another office because I couldn't stop getting up from my desk, crossing my office, and gorging myself on the flaky pastry, the spiced meaty insides and the light, fried delectables in that beautiful Porto's box.If you want to stay on your diet, never, ever eat anything from here.

The pastries were given to us right away and the whole meal was less than $10. They'll also give you a number for your table. And then our food is brought within like 5 minutes.

Healthy (not fat) chicken breast with lettuce (not shredded), tomatoes and like a black bean spread. All the ingredients tasted fresh and went well together. All in all, a wonderful dinner.
