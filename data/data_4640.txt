The smush of the croquettas provided excellent moisture to the sandwich although the lechon wasn't dry (yay!).

I usually get the pastrami, sandwich cubano, or pan con lechon.They have these things called potato balls, which I've never had before, but they're SO GOOD.

There are only 2 Portos in the US from my knowledge, so it's a real treat if you get to stop by one. Their prices are really reasonable, and their sandwiches come with delicious \"marquitas\" - crispy fried plantains (only if you dine in). I recommend trying their hot pastrami, medianoche and tuna melt sandwiches. Their cheese rolls and potato balls make good snacks too, and their almond danish makes a good breakfast treat. They offer yummy shakes and fresh orange juice. Personally, I stick to fountain drinks, because their meals are filling enough without a heavy drink. But on the right warm day, I will treat myself to one of their drinks. Their non-alcoholic mojito is especially refreshing.They have a whole dessert section, and their chocolate cake is good. Expect a sweeter than usual flavor from their desserts.Portos gets really full during lunch and the parking is limited behind the restaurant. You can park on the street on Hollywood Way if the lot is full. The restaurant is very charming inside, with chandeliers and high ceilings. You pay at the counter and they serve you at your table.
