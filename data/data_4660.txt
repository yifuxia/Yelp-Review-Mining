[{"content": "I love the potato balls at Portos! They are my favorite and a must with any order. The cubano sandwich is good but I love the Midnight because it's on the softest sweet roll. The ham and cheese croissant is ok too. The empanadas, meat pies and ham croquettes are all yummy , but the potato balls are still my fav!. This is a great place to order from for a luncheon, dinner party, bday party, or holiday - you get my point. Portos is a lovely touch to any occasion or a great item to show up with. I can't wait to try a dinner plate from here. The cafe au lait is great and I am a hard to please coffee snob. The bakery is insane - there is everything! I like the Parisian, Opera and Checkers cake slices. Soooo good! I honestly can't say I've ever tried something I didn't like. I did want to try to carrot cake but heard it has a lot in it - so I stayed away as I prefer a simple carrot cake. I look forward to trying some other sweets very soon. There are also always two separate lines to order - they move fairly fast and if you are ordering something that needs to prepared in the kitchen, you'll have to wait again for it to be ready as with the coffee drinks - lots of waiting, but things run smoothly and the quality of the items are very good. I could order one of everything and sit outside on the patio and eat myself into oblivion. - awesome spot, enjoy!", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Candace L.", "time": "7/31/2011"}, {"content": "Love love love Porto's...

I paid for it in advance and advised them I'd be in a rush when I came to pick it up Saturday afternoon. They told me not to come until 2 pm because it wouldn't be ready.When I ran in at 2 pm, there was a line a mile long to pick up or order cakes. I tried waiting but it was clear I wasn't going to get out of there until at least 2:30. I asked the manager for help but he said \"tough luck.\"When it was finally my turn to get my cake, the Portos employee came back with a cake that had nothing written on it... even though I'd paid for it in advance. I understand that they don't write on the cakes in advance just in case no one comes to pick it up, but I paid for it! So if I hadn't come, there would've been no harm done!I could've forgiven all that, though, but the truth is the cake wasn't very good. It was way too sweet and tasted like something I could've gotten at Ralphs, although it cost twice as much.I still think Porto's sandwiches, pastries, potato balls, etc. are excellent but I don't think I'll order a cake here again.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Nancy T.", "time": "6/28/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review"}, {"content": "Portos here in Burbank isnt too different from its sister store in Norwalk. It gets very crowded in here no matter what time you come. The pastries seem to be epic while there dining food seem to be very well mediocre. My wife and I ordered two Steak Torta's, two potato balls,two apple strudels and some tortilla soup. The Steak Torta's right off the bat were very cold, but they were good but just wish they were warmer. I assume maybe they were probably sitting on the counter waiting to picked up. They should really develop a better way of delivering people's food to them on time. The tortilla soup wasnt impressive to be honest, I think I can have better anywhere else. The potato balls were freaking AWESOME, and so were the apple strudles. Something I didnt really like all that much were all the flies that were flying around our food and in the bathrooms. Really grossed me out to wave out fly's like I would if I were at a open park. OH and by the way we actually got to see Erik Estrada here! pretty cool to come across a celeb. He took a few pictures with us before we left, so really made up for the cold tortas lol. So if your going to eat here skip it. The pastries are worth it here but to be honest they arent hugely different from any other Latin pastry store and the wait is horrific.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Kikuchiyo S.", "time": "8/10/2011"}, {"content": "I only had one goal for Sunday -- to eat at Porto's and be in carb overload. My good friend came over and after our intensive workout (building one of the two cribs) we needed to fill our belly with carbs. My brain was feeling defeated trying to decipher crib instructions. \u00a0We left the furniture building to the boys.I have many fond memories of chowing down on Cuban fare in Miami. So it's not surprising that Porto's became an obsession after my friend told me about savory potato balls. I was surprised at the sheer monstrous size of Porto's. The parking lot accommodates many, many cars. I just expected the bakery to be very small and quaint. Instead, the bakery was quite large yet comfie with ample seating. We missed the lady in front handing out menus (big mistake as it led to my confusion). There were 2 lines -- one for the bakery/coffee only and another for all items. The line looked long, daunting even. I was shocked at the efficiency of Porto's b/c we were at the head of the line soon enough. The menu on the board is quite misleading. It doesn't list snacks (i.e. potato balls, meat empanadas, meat pies, spinach pies, cheese rolls, etc). But I had read the Yelp reviews so I knew there were many savory snacks to be eaten. \u00a0All of our snack-type items were available as soon as we ordered but the sandwiches are made fresh. We sat down and started eating before our sammies arrived:Potato Ball: Soft delicate potato and savory meaty goodness inside. This marriage of meat and potatoes was aligned by the stars. It was so simple, yet so savory, melt-in-your-mouth good. Empanada: The outside was sweet and the inside was chicken with veggies. I liked the balance between a sweet crust mixed with veggie textures inside. Meat pie: Imagine a croissant filled with meat. I enjoyed it, but the potato ball was a better mechanism for delivering meat to my mouth. Cheese bread: Sweet, not savory. I was thrown off. The cheese was sweet and I believe the bread was more savory. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my fave. By the way, all of these items from above were less than $1 each. Yeah, for reals. I kid you not. I hands down recommend the potato balls, next time I'll opt for 4 potato balls vs. a smorges board of goodness. I ordered the classical Cuban sandwich. It was served on a crusty long bread. The bread is fresh baked. The crustiness is right on. Flaky crispy outside and soft inside, the way bread should be. The sandwich was pretty huge and cost around $5. I best describe this sandwich as a pork melt -- ham, slow roasted pork, melty cheese, pickles and mustard. There's nothing to not love with this combination. While I love ham and pork products, I'm not the biggest lover of pork per se. But this slow roasted pork was juicy, tender and flavorful without being fatty or greasy. The sammie comes with plantain chips. The chips aren't flavorful, but I'm crunch girl, so I totally digged it. We took a break from eating before digging into the tres leches cake. A lady came around with samples of spinach pies. She gave me my own portion, not half, but an entire portion. I was siked. I was eager to try this Cuban spanakopita thing. Buttery croissant exterior stuffed with spinach and cheese. The flaky bread is a better vehicle to deliver spinach and cheese combo vs. meat. I don't want to talk sh*t about the tres leches cake b/c it was moist and milky. But the top had this meringue that reminded me of marshmallows, specifically melted peeps. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I've just had better tres leches cake in Miami, so I'm a bit particular. Next time I'll hit up one of the guava pastries. Before I forget, one of the best things about Porto's is the little tapatio packets. Why doesn't every restaurant in LA have tapatio packets? I freaken love tapatio and generously dipped my savories and sammies in the hot sauce. Porto's is a no brainer. There's no reason to NOT eat here. My friend and I left stuffed and spent $16.99, we ordered to our heart's content. It's cheap, fast and kick-a*s.
