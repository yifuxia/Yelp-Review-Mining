It is a madhouse in there and you kinda need to \"know\" what the hell you want and where you are going when you walk in the place. No time for diddle-daddlers! If you are anxious and sweaty like me, it's probably a good idea to \"research\" or review the menu before you go so you can really spend your time with it. They have tons of pastries and they don't list them all on the board, so basically you need to just get your ass in line and once you can take a peek at what's behind the glass, scramble to figure out what you want. I'm not a big sweet-tooth person, (bc i like it savory! hell ya!) so I just got the Cubano sandwich. It was good, but nothing totally amazing or different. I guess this is strictly a bakery spot so if you love pastries and bread, it probably is really amazing.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Jennifer L.", "time": "1/14/2012"}, {"content": "Mmmmmm!I used to come here for lunch back when well, I used to take lunches, and it was wonderful.
