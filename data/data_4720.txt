Do NOT be afraid of the CUBAN part of the Cuban bakery description, if you are not an adventurous eater.From Great Pastries, like their guava and cheese or chocalate mousse, to their cakes, like their Red Velvet or Fruit tarts, to their sandwiches (like the cubano) and savory treats, they are the best at everything they do.In L.A over half of every wedding has a cake from Porto's. That would be true of the whole country, if they were national.Try their \"potato ball.\" It's a deep-fried mashed-potato ball filled with ground beef. \u00a0Also their chicken croquettes come with a chipotle dipping sauce.

I had heard so many great things about this place from so many different people that of course I had to give it a shot. I bought an Oreo cheesecake (around $24) for a family party, and I was kind of disappointed. I like my cheesecake dense, and this one was flaky. But I think it developed some character over a 24-hour period in the fridge because it was slightly more firm (the way I like it) the next day.And since so many people mentioned the potato balls, I had to try that as well ($0.80 each). Yep. Pretty good. However, I have to admit I like Asian-style croquettes better - in those, the ground meat isn't as flavored, so you add something like tonkatsu sauce to it.I went on a day/time that was EXTREMELY crowded. I was shocked when I walked in. It looked like a line for a Disneyland ride. For newbies, when you walk in, there are two lines. Invariably, both will be long. Luckily, the line went pretty quickly given that they have a ton of staff ready to help you out.I'll try out more next time - maybe I'll give it a 5 then.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Shorty P.", "time": "6/4/2009"}, {"content": "Came here two days ago for dessert. \u00a0 Cheese balls everyone recommends were good. \u00a0 Raspberry cheesecake was ok, as I have had better. \u00a0 Cinnamon bun and cupcake were not good. \u00a0Maybe more stars if I go back and try other stuff.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Gary K.", "time": "9/13/2012"}, {"content": "I've tasted 2 different cakes from Porto's at one of my BBQ's last summer, and they were excellent.

She warned me that this place always gets super packed during lunch time and that parking is kind of a nightmare here despite the parking lot designated to it. She was right about both. There is so much drama in the parking lot. Haha..However, there are two sides to this place when you enter. One appears to look like it serves hot food, and the other side appears to look like it's designated for bakery. BUT! You can go in either line and order whatever you want. So if you find yourself following everyone and standing in the longer line for lunch, go ask the worker there at the door (at least when I was there, there was someone at the door handing out menus for ppl to look at in line) she was the one that told me to go in the shorter line. I got the midnight (medianoche) sandwich which is just like the Cubano but it's on sweet bread rather than the Cuban bread which was delish. I had a bite of my friend's sandwich was the cubano to just try the bread and it's just crispier and not sweet whereas the sweet bread is much softer and sweeter. I liked mine better, and it was a dollar cheaper too! (3.65) SO CHEAP!!!! And I also had a potato ball since that's all the rage here. Didn't floor me, only b/c it's just like those potato croquettes that I get from the Korean bakery and at 85 cents a potato ball, I prefer to just get my potato croquette for a dollar which is more bang for my buck and I don't have to go to LA to have it. The plantain chips that came with the sandwich were off the hook, just wish they gave me more. Haha...Regrets: I wanted to try a slice of the Cuban pineapple cake but I opted not to since my friends weren't ordering much and I didn't want to look like a fatty. I'm so sad. It looks so good. I wanted to try the 3 leches cake too. Sigh......... I'll live. My friend says she always gets her birthday cakes here tho.Seating is a little tough to find, and there's not that much space.
