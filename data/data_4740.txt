The place was so cheap , I could not resist. Everything was really great, I was a little disappointed in the cuban sandwich , it didnt seem to have been made in the proper manner . I thought the bread was supposed to be pressed and have a light buttery taste. it was still good though. the ropa viejo sandwich was very satisfying though. \u00a0Meat pie and the cheese ball thing were excellent. I could probs eat like \u00a010 of them. \u00a0I also scored a chocolate croissant as well as a guava strudel. both very very good.next time i am in burbank. i will be back.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Regina C.", "time": "5/8/2010"}, {"content": "Had lunch here yesterday.There is not much more I can add to everyone's reviews. I do have to say that this place has established a cult following similar to In-N-Out. How? like that burger place, it really is nothing special. But there is a magic to the place that keeps bringing people back.The lines are out of control, especially during the lunch rush. I had the Steak Torta, ok. Had the plantains with mojo sauce. Wow. Delicious.I asked for black beans and rice and they do not serve that until after 2pm. The service is a bit slow as you have to make a line, pay, and take your number to your table for them to bring the food to you. For a place this busy, I would have expected their operations to be smoother.Their pastries are barnone top notch. I had the Horchata drink (popular rice-based drink) and was very impressed with it. Had a large but kept me wanting more. Brace yourself as parking behind the locale is always full and limited two hour parking in the street in front. You may have to do some walking.I now know why a friend of ours had her wedding cake done by Porto's.

Yum!Espresso and coffee: started off with an espresso--yum! Bold and leaves a great aftertaste. Followed up with a coffee, which was piping hot at first.
