But having been to Tampa a bunch of times & falling in love with Cuban sandwiches & cafe con leche, it was a total letdown. I shouldn't've been that surprised, though; Burbank is a far shot from Tampa.I should qualify that rant, though; the Cuban sandwich was pretty decent. The bread was really good, which is, of course, extremely important, & the meat was very flavorful.My biggest issue was with the coffee. If you order cafe con leche anywhere in Florida, it comes sweet. Very sweet. If it doesn't, it's because they asked you if you want sugar & you said no. At Porto's, I ordered a cafe con leche & was asked simply, \"hot or cold?\" & it was a hot day, so I said cold.When we got our drinks & food I took a seat, took a sip, & nearly spat it out. No sugar! & worse, it was already on ice, which means that I couldn't just ADD sugar to sweeten it (sugar doesn't dissolve in cold liquids, or at least it takes FOREVER). I considered asking them if they had any fructose (in Taiwan & Japan you can get little cups of it, like creamer, for your cold drinks), but figured (a) I've never seen that in the States yet & (b) it was just too busy to fight my way up to the counter to ask for it.So I stirred in a bunch of sugar, & stirred & stirred & stirred till I was long since done with my food, & it still tasted terrible. Lesson learned: Specify whether you want your coffee sweet or not.However, I should mention that my fiancee, who loves coffee, did enjoy his, so take from that what you will.If I find myself in LA for a long spell again & am craving a Cuban & some cafe con leche, I'll probably wander back here but be careful to specify exactly what I want so I don't end up as crestfallen as I was when I first tried it.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Sally M.", "time": "5/19/2009"}, {"content": "F*cking Love this Place!!!

Finished with pure Belgian chocolate ganache.does it sound any better?! i asked the girl if it was popular. she said shes never tried it but the sound of orange with chocolate disgusted her. some ppl like it some ppl dont. well u know what.... i love orange with chocolate! they compliment each other very well. so i decided to just try it out hoping that it will be good. so what happened? it was \u00a0popular! my friend whos not big on desserts had a 2nd slice. well whatta ya know....... its a hit! i thought it would be too much chocolate or too much of an alcohol aroma, don't want to get drunk u know? but no. there was a perfect amount of chocolate and it was so soft and fluffy.OooH and- NOTE: dont take it out of refridgerator unless u eat it right away. within 30 mins of taking it out. it will start to melt.. yes melt. the mousse is very light and fluffy so there is not alot density in the cake for it to stay up.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Amy V.", "time": "2/25/2009"}, {"content": "I sing praises while I stuff my face with Porto's cheese rolls and wash every last crumb down with their iced coffee.
