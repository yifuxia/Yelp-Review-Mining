[{"content": "The BEST bakery in Los Angeles. Portos has been a long time childhood bakery of my family's and we have loved every bit of it since we had discovered the place! Parking is probably the hardest thing you will ever have to deal with in your life when it comes to parking spots, it's extremely limited. Be prepared for massive lines, that end near the entrance. Know what you want to order before you actually get to the front to order! The lines go pretty fast, but there will be some waiting to do. The best thing there are their cheese rolls, in my opinion. Of course everything else there is excellent, however the cheese rolls are what you call \"A+\" dessert. Super clean place, but hectic. The bakery is stuffed with people everywhere. Customer service is excellent, they handle large crowds very well. Overall, an incredible bakery.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Noesh H.", "time": "6/10/2016"}, {"content": "The Media Noche is top on my list of favorites at Porto's.The meat is full of flavor and mixes well with the Swiss(?) cheese.

These lil sluggers are one of my favorite appetizers in all of LA. Sadly, the spuds are surrounded by sandwich duds, as the cubano is a soggy, rubber-faced and stale gulp to behold. Look... in a pinch, id eat the sucker, but because I always remember to wear green on st. Patrick's day, that's never going to be the case for this worldly food critic. Would I come back? Well, in the words of the euphonic meatloaf...

I never thought bakeries could be so big and have so many different kinds of desserts!! I mean this place is like a warehouse for desserts! Notice how many times I said desserts in the first three sentences? Yea, there's a reason for that, I'm trying to put into perspective just how many different desserts there truly are! It's easy to walk away with a minimum of three boxes...of desserts. Also there are big lines but don't let that intimidate you. The ladies and gents working behind the counter are very efficient and have amazing memories. They don't write anything down, just memorize and box. if your sweet tooth is nagging just think PORTOS!

We used PORTO'S as our wedding cake vendor. We love their Parisian cake soooo much that we wanted that cake blown up into an incredibly huge proportion enough to give our guests a small portion each and keep the rest to ourselves... HOWEVER, since they have such excellent staff, they recommended that we choose a different flavor cake due to our wedding being outdoors in the summer... You would think that as a bride and groom absolutely in love with Parisian cake that we would go weddzilla... but we didn't! Ask me why? Because they had us taste test a bunch of summer flavors that we absolutely loved and still went through with using them as our cake vendors. We got a couple tiers of guava cake and mocha which was the perfect cake for our wedding. We also as always, had to order Parisian cake to go...In regards to my typical interactions with PORTO'S, I recommend their- Parisian cake if you love love love chocolate- potato balls and make sure you hot sauce it up!- Blueberry/berry tres leches! Order as much as you can and hide it in the back of the fridge for your own personal consumption!- Their COFFEES are yummy- \u00a0Tuna sannich oh yeah- \u00a0Cheese rolls- \u00a0Guava rolls- Polvoron cookies The downside to PORTO'S amazing food is it's popularity which yields long lines... just come during odd hours and hopefully there's a shorter line.Staff are straight to business and they work fast.

I've also experienced this place differently from others because..... I live literally 4 streets away lol. It's a 7 minute walk.The lines have become crazier and crazier. The best time to come here are in the mornings & around 2-3ish. If you come during lunch or towards their closing hours, be prepared to wait! However, the lines DO move. The longest I've waited in line is 30 minutes. I know the lines can look frighteningly long, but a lot of people in line are with a few people making the line look a lot longer than it actually is. There are also a lot of workers working at one time. So believe me, the lines will move! LolParking.... good luck lol. If you're here during the rush, it'll be hard, but they do have parking in the back of their building, and it extends to the parking lot the next block over. I believe the residential street nearby requires a permit now to keep Portos customers away, so beware of parking posts. Please don't get a ticket lol. You can park on the main streets though if you find a spot!What are the most popular things here:1. Cheese rolls2. Potato ballsWhat else are favorites/commonly bought here:1. Dulce de leche kisses2. Cakes of all kinds (my favorite is the dulce de leche)3. Fruit tartWhat is underrated, but should be given more light:1. Spinach feta croissant2. Guava cheese rolls3. Mango empanadas4. Meat piesDrinks I'd recommend:1. Mango smoothie2. Horchata FrapSandwiches:1. STEAK TORTA!!!!!!!! It's the only sandwich I've tried here, but it's so good. I highly recommend it. Sometimes I sub out the torta for a croissant instead, and it's such a good alternative too!!! This sandwich comes with guac which makes it everything.
