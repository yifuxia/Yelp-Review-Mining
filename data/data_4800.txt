[{"content": "This place represents my ideal for quick service (even when there's a line) meets casual dining & takeout in Los Angeles.The food, both the bakery items AND the hot/prepared foods are consistently, exceptionally good. Their fruit juices and coffee drinks are superb. I'll stop in here for pastries to take to business meetings, lunch with friends & family, they cater my kids parties and their spectacular, reasonably priced cakes adorn the table for every celebratory event in our house.Porto's staff is sweet, helpful and quick.

This place is amazing! No wonder it was packed. There was a long line which almost reached the entrance when i went on a sunday, but it moved along quickly especially because they handed out cheese rolls for the wait. The cheese rolls are a must have. They are aaaaamazing. The potato balls are good as well & the guava/cheese roll. It's clean, the bathroom smells more like a bakery than the actual restaurant, wonderful mouthwatering pastries at cheap prices!

You cannot go wrong with the Guava Cheese rolls, potato balls or the tasty pastries. I was so pleased to know that they serve things besides cake, like fruit tart! yummm, becuase lets face it, cake after a while can become pretty monotonous... no? no one thinks so? Well I do LOLThe fruit tart is so good, this might sound bad but if anyone ever gets me a cake from here I will not be happy because I prefer the fruit tart over any of their cake anyday anywhere LOL but their cakes are really really good too. The coconut cake with pineapple filling for that pina colada fix, or the chocolate raspberry mousse or the opera cake... I have yet to try the other cakes but I do know they make pretty good Tres Leches cake. Not too soggy, not dry... juuuuust right :)Overall a great place to come and get something to eat, or some nicel ittle treat for yourself after a long day. Pastries to try would include the Chocolate Croissant, Apple Turnover, Feta Spinach puff pastry, Mango Cheesecake (or was it flan, *shrug*) Guava Cheese rolls, cheese rolls mmm-mm-mmm", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Fernando H.", "time": "11/12/2009"}, {"content": "It can be a bit of a madhouse, but the food is great, cheap and so many endless levels of delicious.

I am writing my second pastry and bakery review in a row, and I couldnt tell you the last time I went to a bakery in my hometown. I just happen to see great reviews on yelp and check it out and it was great that i did.The only pastry I had was the cheese rolls. I really liked them. Again, I am not much of a pastry guy, but my family seemed to go nuts for them so they deserve 5 stars.What I really enjoyed was a green tea smoothie. It was really unlike anything I had ever had. It did taste a like green tea but the smoothie form really went well.

If it's your first time you have to try the cheese, cheese & guava or guava rolls! They are legendary! Their cookies and other baked goods are of the highest quality. A huge selection of sooooo many treats. It's split in two sides. One side is the bakery the other side is the restaurant. Yes restaurant.......They make incredible sandwiches. It's a Cuban bakery, so I recommend the Cuban Sandwiches and the media noche. Simply superb. And they have wonderful potato balls and meat pies........these are addicting little snacks! You have to try them. They also have an excellent catering menu. It's very well organized and it may seem crazy busy......the staff knows what they are doing. Very nice decor and very clean. Great place to say \"screw my diet, I'm letting loose!\".........Sorry mom, I promise I'll get to gym.........after I eat some cheese rolls.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Alfred D.", "time": "1/30/2009"}]
