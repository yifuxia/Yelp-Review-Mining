[{"content": "Cuban bakery/eatery.\rI started going to Porto's when I was a wee Colombian pup. The original location is on Brand Blvd. in Glendale. I would visit with my mom and sis. The bakery was a horse shoe shape. People grabbed a number from the big red number thingy and they waited in droves as one of the friendly counter helpers called out their numbers. Serving everything from Cuban bread, beef filled potato balls or puff pastries to Cuban sandwiches and birthday cakes, this place made me happy.\rSo they opened up a new Porto's in Burbank. This one is fancier and \u00a0a bit more organized. I was afraid that the new digs would affect the yumminess of the food, but everything is still as amazing as I remember. \rI love SF, but I miss my Porto's\rI RECOMMEND:\rPotato Balls: ground beef mixed with tomatoes, olives and God knows what else, surrounded by creamy, yet firm mashed taters, lightly breaded and fried to golden perfection.\rMeat Pies: Same filling as the potatoes, but in a nice little puff pastry. I think they brush the top with a thinned out sugar glaze. Sounds weird, but it is what makes you want to buy 50 and freeze them for later.\rGuava Pies: same amazing puff pastry filled with sweet guava paste. You can also get them with cheese. \rCuban sandwich: Cuban bread, crusty and oh so good. Thinly sliced pork loin, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickles. Pressed gently in a hot flat Cuban sandwich press. Heaven.\rIf you are ever in Burbank or Glendale, stop by Porto's and you'll forget you are in Burbank or Glendale.\rThere is so much more to talk about, but you can see for yourself. \rcheck out the photos I took and look at their web site too.\rportosbakery.com", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Claudia O.", "time": "8/9/2006"}, {"content": "It's open people! What are you waiting for?Packed full of all the same delicious YUMMYNESS as the one in Glendale, a brand new Porto's has opened on the corner of Hollywood Way and Magnolia! Baked goods, mouth-watering sammiches, tah die for eclairs and specialty cakes and much much more.If you haven't popped your Porto's cherry yet, then I highly recommend doing so.

I finally made the trek and it was WELL worth it!We practically ended up with half of the bakery stuffed into my car to bring home because everything looked so delicious and was SO incredibly cheap and affordable. Honestly, we brought home a car full of food for only about $70 (and that was pretty pastries and a cake too).For lunch, the medianoche was amazing and only about $3.00, how can you beat that!!??! The steak sandwich was also really good, super tender, and super flavorful. The best part about the lunch was the plantain chips they serve it with, I had to bring a box home just to snack on!Potato balls are a must! Crispy fried mashed potato stuffed with meat, how could you go wrong? Meat pies are awesome as well.What they are most famous for is their cheese and guava cheese rolls, we brought 3 dozens home for the family and they disappeared within days! But they keep really well too, the guava ones are like something you've never tried, just creamy, flaky and delicious.For desserts, the tiramisu and tres leches were ok, I wouldn't recommend them but their mango mousse cheesecake and mango mouse cake are my absolute favorite!!!!! So fresh and creamy. Italian mascarpone cheesecake was amazing too, almost everything caught my eye here.

\u00a01. \u00a0The workers (a few) need some reminders about food handling - mainly the ones serving and bringing items to you. \u00a0I have seen a couple hand-covered sneezes (even if just allergies, it shouldn't happen.) \u00a0I also personally don't like walking along the sidewalk down the block to see employees smoking. \u00a0If they can't find them a nice away-place to break, at least have a smoking area that isn't right on the way to the restaurant. \u00a0Just because they aren't smoking next to Porto's entrance, doesn't mean they aren't breaking Burbank's within-20-feet-of-an-exit no smoking rule.2. \u00a0Another big problem. \u00a0I can't stand when I see a person cleaning tables with a washcloth, running around from table to table, and then watch as they use that same washcloth to wipe down the seats of a baby chair. \u00a0That is disgusting no matter what you think about their intention. \u00a0Again, they need to better train anyone who touches food or food service areas. \u00a0Table tops, not baby butts!3. \u00a0I agree with some folks here who have issue with their system for serving/picking up food. \u00a0The two lines for drinks/food are pretty annoying given they are next to each other. \u00a0Plus, the small service area for utensils and sodas is so cramped when busy that you feel you have just gone somewhere for free samples. \u00a0Napkins, lids, cups, forks, trash, drink dispensers are pretty much in one area (they have a 2nd area but it is around the corner in the back and really only helpful if you are sitting back there.)4. \u00a0The banana chips have turned from a thing of beauty into a gross addition to the sandwiches. \u00a0Either stop serving them with the sandwiches or make them the way they used to be - ie. good. \u00a0I don't know how many times I have literally gotten ill looking at the scrapings from the bottom of the bag that are dumped on a sandwich plate along with what is usually a good sandwich. \u00a0Don't mess it up. \u00a0Fix em or dump em.5. \u00a0Either enforce the seating lounge is for waiting-only or don't say anything about it at all. \u00a0We have been told not to sit there by staff because it is for people waiting for others. \u00a0But I won't even tell you how many times I see folks sitting there eating away like there is no tomorrow - and no one says 'excuse me, this is for waiting only'.6. \u00a0Stop ignoring the fact that people are stealing sodas left and right using the tiny water cups or their own cups. \u00a0Move the water-only dispenser somewhere else so it isn't so easy to steal. \u00a0It is disheartening to know you paid for your own soda and others are sneaking freebies without care.7. \u00a0Same holds true for napkin dispensers. \u00a0Watching someone literally grab 2\" of napkins and shove them in her purse would be more easily prevented if the dispensers are right at the cashier area - plus they would not empty so fast and be left that way for long. \u00a0Ignoring the problem does not save anyone any money. \u00a0We all end up paying for those thieves.8. \u00a0Please, please, please - is it too much to ask to have a simple label on each tray of pastry?? \u00a0You used to be great at it and it has now gotten ridiculous. \u00a0Do you not realize how much time you waste having to repeatedly answer the question 'what is that?' with each and every customer who points at numerous unlabeled trays? \u00a0You might be able to shorten your long-long lines a bit if you'd make decisions a lot easier for folks before they get someone to help them out.9. \u00a0And it isn't necessarily your sole problem, but please ask the City of Burbank for meters on Magnolia along the side where you currently have green painted curbs. \u00a0If people are going to cheat for an hour to eat in a 10 minute zone, at least make them pay a couple quarters for the trouble and actually feel they might get ticketed. \u00a0This area is being abused now more and more, because everyone is learning nobody checks or tickets cars!So main suggestions to Porto's would be:* \u00a0better food handling and cleanliness training* \u00a0move water-only fountain to an area all by itself * \u00a0put the napkin dispensers as you leave the cashier* \u00a0keep title cards on all your pastries. \u00a0* \u00a0ask the City of Burbank to put 15 minute meters on MagnoliaAfter getting that all out, yes, we eat at Porto's regularly, yes the sandwiches are good, and sure, I recommend it. \u00a0But that doesn't mean I'm a pushover. \u00a0To be so close to getting something right but missing the ball on the easy stuff is grounds for a couple stars dropped I'd say.", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Kay S.", "time": "4/16/2010"}, {"content": "Most of my coworkers can attest to my love of this place.
