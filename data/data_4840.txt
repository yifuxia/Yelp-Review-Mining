The lines inside look really intimidating, but they have the service down to a science, and it really doesn't take very long to order your food. They even have a separate line for people who just want bakery items! The food, of course, is outstanding. Our favorite sandwiches are the pan con lechon and medianoche (Hubby prefers his with the ham croquetas), accompanied by the potato balls, empanadas and meat pies! Of course, we can't refuse the flaky, tangy, creamy goodness of the refugiados! The cakes are also fantastic (especially the Cuban with the brandy syrup!), as are the Cuban crackers, which have been a favorite of mine since childhood.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Monica H.", "time": "10/10/2012"}, {"content": "I love this place.
