[{"content": "I'm going to give this place 5 stars because:1) service- when i walked in i was very intimidated. I had no idea what was happening. There were two lines, people everywhere. I told the woman at the door it was my first time here and where do I go to get the potato balls and a red velvet cup cake and she happily told me where I need to stand in line. 2) the food it self- I was told by friends that the potato balls were devine! So I bought 4 of those and the red velvet cupcake i was eyeing. My boyfriend and I bit into the potato balls and we felt the taste was something we had before but couldn't put our fingers on. I preceeded to gobble down the potato ball when my boyfriend said that it tasted like TACO BELL ! I laughted so hard! It did taste like that only because of the grounded beef in the middle along with cheese. It was still really good though. My red velvet cake was one of the best I've had so far. It was a smaller cupcake but it was really moist, not too rich yet not too plain, and the frosting was so creemy and pleasing! 3) parking/waiting in line- parking wasn't too bad. The place is always crowded but we found a spot right away so I think that was more luck then anything. You can park behind the place if im not mistaken, and on the street. The wait to get my goodies was maybe 5 to 10 minutes. They try their best to help everyone with what they need and very friendly while doing so.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Allison T.", "time": "12/18/2009"}, {"content": "good food but tiramisu tastes kinda grossagain, con: parking", "rating": "3.0 star rating", "name": "Jay C.", "time": "2/2/2012"}, {"content": "Portos has the best bakery I've ever tried.

I have yet to try anything from the bakery side, but I was very tempted to. \u00a0In fact, looking back on it, I'm not sure how I managed not to try anything. \u00a0Maybe because I was stuffed from the potato ball (get one! \u00a0Or ten!) and Cubano sammie I had eaten before? \u00a0Boggles the mind, really. \u00a0I'll have to prime myself for some serious eating next time so I'll have room for dessert.Keep in mind that the system Porto's has come up with to organize the crowd, orders and dispersal of sammies is quite impressive. \u00a0It looks totally unorganized and frenetic, but it all works out in the end so there are no complaints. \u00a0I ordered the Cubano and would definitely get it again...That is, if I'm not tempted by the multitude of other sandwiches on the menu. \u00a0And believe me, there is a great deal of temptation going on there. \u00a0I've already made a note-to-self to try the Medianoche and the Potato Ball sammie (heh heh).", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Brandy S.", "time": "4/10/2009"}, {"content": "Despite their small parking and long lines, anything you order from here is fresh and tasty!

Chicken empanadas have a nice pastry crust and while I have found dry chicken in my empanadas, more often than not the stuffing has been moist.

Overall a great place with good food! My sister lives in Burbank and visits this establishment often. Everything I've tried from the bakery side thus far is good stuff. From the deli/cafe side, I've had a few items: -cubano sandwich. Excellent. My only wish was for more of it! -plantain chips that pretty much comes with everything here. They're okay. Kinda fun to munch on, but nothing spectacular for me. -\"pork sandwich\". The one with the garlic spread. Pretty good! Mine was a tad dry though. -tortilla soup. interesting. tasted like a liquefied tamale. not a bad thing. -potato balls. love these things! seasoned ground beef encapsulated by a deep fried mashed potato shell.
