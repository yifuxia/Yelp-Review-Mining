It was worth it. We walked in and while the line was long, it moved quickly and gave us some time to look over the extensive Porto's menu. I was amazed by the wide variety of sandwiches, empanadas, pastries, salads, and authentic Cuban deliciousness. Oh and might I add the extremely reasonable prices? $4 for a sandwich - yes please.After an extensive internal battle, I finally decided on a Porto's specialty Cuban sandwich, the Medianoche. \u00a0Along with that I ordered a fruit tart from the beautiful dessert display case . Although the place was packed, we immediately found seating and brought our numbers to the table and anxiously awaited our lunch. When the food arrived, the first thing I tried was the Potato Ball. Trademarked Porto's classic! Warm meat-filled ball of \u00a0fried potato cheese heaven. I highly recommend. Next was my sandwich. It was perfection. Ham, pork, gooey cheese and mustard all on sweet Cuban bread. It was so tasty I ordered two more to take home with me. All I can say is I can't wait to go back. I need to think of more excuses to head out to Burbank. \u00a0Tour of the Warner Bros. lot perhaps?My recommendation to anyone heading there who is a Porto's newbie like I was is make sure to give yourself enough time to look over the menu and to find parking.

I went to the one in the right where all the pastries were. While in line, one of the workers came along and gave us samples of their mango wheat bread? It was good. It made me wonder how a sandwich would taste on their FRESH MADE BREAD. The next time I'm there, I will definitely try to go there for lunch dine in. Any how, we were helped by a nice gentlemen named Raul. He found out we were from the bay area and insisted that we try the cheese roll, so he gave us a complimentary roll to try. We ended up ordering 6 dz, a brunch of other pastries, couple small fruit tarts, creme brulee and a large fruit tart and tiramusi cake. We were like a kid in a candle store. When we finally tried everything, this is what we concluded - the cheese rolls are a must, try the guava and cheese - since they aren't offered anywhere else and fruit tart are delicious.

They couldn't guarantee it, but at least they were nicer about it. \u00a0The cake was disgusting. \u00a0I tried it the day of the party, and it just seemed off to me, not what I'm used to and not really what my sister told me it was supposed to be. \u00a0The next day, we took the leftovers out and tried it again - it was still disgusting. \u00a0It was dry, had absolutely no taste and really wasn't the flavor she had ordered. \u00a0We ended up throwing it away. \u00a0Let me tell you that we are a CAKE-LOVING family, we DO NOT throw cake away. \u00a0This was the worst cake I had ever had from Porto's.So, to sum up, they've gotten too big and their customer service, especially upstairs at Glendale, has suffered. \u00a0Horrible customer service, terrible tasting cakes. \u00a0And when they say the make custom cakes, it really means that they can only make the custom cakes they've already made. \u00a0It's a shame you can't keep up with the 3-D custom cake craze. \u00a0Too bad for you, but I just found a perfect little bakery in the heart of Van Nuys that can!Sorry, Porto's you've lost your place in cake heaven. \u00a0RIP. \u00a0Never again....", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "Maricela L.", "time": "2/28/2011"}, {"content": "This is one of the most overrated places in all of Los Angeles.
