[{"content": "I love going to this Portos. \u00a0I love their Dulce De Leche Kiss and potato balls. \u00a0Let me tell you their Dulce De Leche Kiss is really good! \u00a0It's a cookie shaped like a Hershey kiss filled with caramelized sweet milk. \u00a0I don't really know but that cookie thing is good. \u00a0Aside from the fact that it is closer to home, I think this store has a better line system than the one in Glendale. \u00a0At this location they have maybe just two or three lines (pastries, sandwiches, and cake lines). \u00a0You can go to the sandwich line and still get the pastries, potato balls, and drinks that you like. \u00a0Of course they have the long line for the pastries and all the other delightful desserts. \u00a0:)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Glad H.", "time": "11/14/2011"}, {"content": "I have to admit that I was skeptical about this place, even after reading a lot of fantastic reviews on here. You see, yesterday I tried two highly-rated places on yelp: one was closed and the other was not enticing at all. Once I saw the front of this place, I was hopeful that my luck would change. And it did.The place itself is very nice, big, and not at all what I picture for a bakery. When you walk in you have to choose to get in line to the left or to the right because the counters are set up in an \"L\" and the entrance is at the bottom left of the \"L\". From what I saw, the only difference is that the counter on the right is much longer and that there are whole cakes on display over there. The food is great. I had the cheese and the cheese-guava rolls - highly recommended. I hadn't realized they would be sweet, but they are indeed pastries. Yum! I didn't like the meat inside the potato ball, but I know I am in the minority here. I also had a mango smoothie, which was delicious and topped with homemade whipped cream. The red velvet cupcake actually tastes like chocolate and is delicious, unlike most others that taste like artifical red food coloring to me. I also highly recommend it. I am a chocolate aficionado and didn't love the flourless chocolate cake - it was like a very dense chocolate mousse. Perhaps it was just because I had run out of room in my belly!The staff is indeed friendly, patient, and helpful. I arrived 15 minutes before they closed and did not feel rushed. It sounds like it's a great time to go based on what everyone else is saying, because I had no problem with parking or long lines.

Wow - so much better than those banana chips you can find in the bulk section of the health food aisle. I also learned that if you come here early in the morning (I think I was here a little after 8:00), you can buy bags of their yummy pastries for next to nothing. I bought a huge bag of dulce de leche cookies for $2. It was heaven. I had enough for me and enough to share. I also threw some in the freezer to have with coffee later in the week.

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich is my personal favorite. The dinner plate of beans and rice, fried plantains, and your choice of meat is a protein lover's delight.
