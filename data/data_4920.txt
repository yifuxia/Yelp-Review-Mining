Yes, I'm just one of those million victims who would die just for a piece of whatever Porto's have to offer. The usual suspects: cheese rolls, potato balls, and meat pie! Okay I'm gonna keep my focus while writing about Porto's as I have a piece of cheese roll next to me, tempt me, *drool* me....The long lines of Porto's reminded me of a roller coaster lines where your heart beats faster as you move forward waiting for your turn to place an order. And the wait is paid off when you were handed a yellow/brown box full of warm happiness. And this happiness comes cheap! Like less than a dollar a piece kind of cheap.my fave:Meat Pie - puff pastry filled with seasoned ground beef. Puff puff pastry... Scrumptious potato balls - ground beef surrounded by mushy mashed potatoes, then lightly coated with breading and deep fried to perfection...Hella bomb cheese rolls - baked pastry with cream cheese inside with sugary sprinkle on top. you just can't go wrong with these bad boys!Enough drooling, now it's time to eat my roll I have abandoned for 10 minutes...

I felt I was at Willy Wonka factory but unfortunately there were sandwiches that was derailing me to giving this place a golden 5 star review. My pan de leche sandwich was very dry and I had to add mayo for some better taste and my sister's sandwich with marinated steak was only ok as well. However the banana chips that it come with yums!

Just okay is all. The pan cubano was most, tender with a hint of cumin that stays with you for the rest of the day. It was okay, but a little salty but one thing you can't say about Portos is that they skimp on the meat. They really pack these things full--one is def enough to share with a friend. I also had the pan con bistec--the meat is identical to that of a beef burrito, sans the jalapeno seeds. It's full of pulled beef, diced tomatos, grilled onions and green bell peppers. It was good, but probably something I wouldn't get again. I had the cubano sandwich a long while ago. I didn't notice it on the menu, but that ones a definite winner of the three.As for pastries, I've only had the guava cream cheese pastry and it is to die for. It can get a little packed here, and it was so busy the last time I went that they forgot my sandwich in some place where it ended up getting soggy before I could get my mitts on it.

They are not only a flashback to my childhood, but a reminder of all the great celebrations Porto's has been a part of.My personal favorites are Potato balls: Crispy on the outside, formed in a nice size ball, with warm, mashed potato surrounding a ground meat center. PERFECT!Guava Cheese Strudel-Flaky, buttery goodness with a guava and cheese filling that is sweet but not overpowering... This friend can not be imitated!Cubano-(Cuban sandwich) Slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese mustard and pickles on Cuban bread. The perfect item for a delicious lunch, OR dinner!!! Mango Mousse Cake- this is the celebration cake of choice at my house, birthdays, graduations, baby showers, this cake is amazing! And better than your basic icing and bland grocery store cake.
