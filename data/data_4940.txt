The scent of baked goods hits you the second you step out of your car in anticipation of all of their mouthwatering treats. mmmmmmOn our last trip to Porto's my family went straight in line to order our pastries. I'd suggest trying:-the cheese rolls (drools)-guava cheese strudels-mango empanadas- dulce de leche kisses-red velvet cupcakes-potato ballsThe cheese rolls are out of this world, and I wish I could eat them everyday! :)Oh yes, and I tried one of their guava smoothies this time around-I would definitely recommend this flavor! We had lunch here after ordering our pastries; the Cuban pork sandwich with caramelized onions and this garlic mayo was sort of bland. However, we also ordered \u00a0this marinated chicken sandwich with Cuban black beans, lettuce, and some other sauce; it was tastier. Sandwiches were served with a side of fried bananas.
