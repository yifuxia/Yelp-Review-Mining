A couple of months ago during a trip to LA I looked this loc up, stupidly thinking I'd be heading to the original portos in Glendale.(As the freeway went on and on:) Why aren't I there yet? I had to call a friend of mine who's from the area to find out that I was headed an extra 15 miles past my intended destination. Yet I persisted.Got there, purchased my 2 dz cheese rolls & potato balls.[Cheese Rolls.] Crisp, sweet, and the BEST pastry I've ever tasted. The beauty of these treats is they can be enjoyed fresh, and AFTER in various ways: cold (from the fridge), nuked in the microwave, or toasted in the oven.So I left portos and ended up getting lost again. After throwing a fit and shedding some frustrated tears I realized that maybe I'm not LA freeway Savvy. (Not trying to be, obviously) But after turning to the Portos boxes I had on my passenger seat I felt better.My Personal Perfect Portos meal: 2 potato balls for your main fill and a cheese roll for dessert.

Best part about Portos is the price. The food is super yummy, but it tastes even better knowing you didn't break the bank for some pastries! I decided to bring home some goodies for the family. Here's the order breakdown: 1 dozen potato balls, 1 dozen emphenadas, 1 feta cheese sandwhich, 1 dozen dulce de leche cookies, 3 brownies, and 1 red velvet cupcake. Grand total was 38 bucks. HELL TO THE YES. As for how the food tasted, the potato balls were as good as they say, the red velvet cupcake was a little dry, and the outer crust on the emphenadas was a bit sweet which was kind of odd.
