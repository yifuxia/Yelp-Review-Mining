[{"content": "My friend Rachael loves this place so much, she can't stop talking about it. \u00a0In the days leading up to my visit, Porto's would monopolize our discussion when it came to pastries and desserts. \u00a0\"You're gonna love this place! \u00a0The potato balls are awesome, the cheese pastries, we go there all the time!! \u00a0We're gonna get one of everything!!!\" \u00a0She gets quite passionate about things that light her up - - and after my visit there with her I'd say her excitement was justified. \u00a0Walking in - - first thing you see are the LONG LINES! \u00a0Ugh! \u00a0I dislike long lines, and sometimes the lines form outside too. \u00a0I don't like to wait, but there are 2 lines (plus 1 more for the dining area) so I tell myself to suck-it-up and enjoy the moment. \u00a0Plus I have to work to contain Rachael's excitement as I lose sight of her as she runs ahead of me to get into line asap. \u00a0 BTW - she's bouncing up and down non-stop just like Tigger. \u00a0Wow - so many choices and options! \u00a0It can be overwhelming, especially to those who like a variety because everything looks so appetizing. \u00a0As usual I review the Yelp highlights which said: \u00a0\"potato balls, meat pie, guava, mango, and plantain chips\". \u00a0That's alotta food to handle - although it just might be enough as I look over at Rachael with her high energy and metabolism (she's still jumping up and down in excitement awaiting her turn at the counter). A plethora of people to assist you with your order, she takes the lead and orders a dozen cheese pastries and potato balls, half dozen lemon cakes, some apple empanadas, a mango smoothie. \u00a0I got guava pastry, meat pie, spinach & cheese, mango cheesecake, and a cuban sandwich to go with a green tea smoothie. \u00a0The meat pie and potato balls were DA BOMB! \u00a0Superb and lived up to the hype. \u00a0That meat pastry was delicate and flavorful, and those balls just rocked the house w/ a combination of meat and potato inside. \u00a0I could have easily eaten a half dozen and now I know why Rachael ordered that much. \u00a0A close 2nd place was the cheese pastry - delicate and crispy. \u00a0I liked my green tea smoothie and Rachael's mango smoothie - - not too sweet or overpowering. \u00a0The pricing seemed quite reasonable too - - very nice. The guava didn't do it for me - while the pastry was good the guava was like a thin jelly / spread consistency. \u00a0It had some flavor yet I was expecting something more robust w/ substantial pieces of the actual guava fruit. \u00a0The spinach & cheese was like any other that I've had in the past, and the mango cheese cake was okay - - it wasn't over the top as I was expecting more mango flavor like I got from the smoothie. \u00a0Had a bite of the lemon cake - it was solid, then ate half of the cuban there since it was hot and fresh. \u00a0It wasn't the best cuban I've had but it was still good, somewhat bland and lacked flavor compared to others I've had, just add pepper and I'm good. \u00a0 \u00a0Superb meat pastry pie + potato balls + cheese pastry + green tea smoothie, reasonable pricing, nice ambiance, and lots of help and attentive service = 4.5-stars in my book so we'll round this up to 5-stars. \u00a0As I'm practicing being Mindful by enjoying the nice weather and delectable pastries it occurred to me how quiet and peaceful it was, not a sound coming from Tigger Rachael. \u00a0No wonder - she was in a trance enjoying her potato ball and sipping on her mango smoothie, then a bite of a cheese pastry. \u00a0All that solidified her ultimate foodgasm. \u00a0She catches me looking at her and asks: \u00a0\"so if you lived here wouldn't you come here every week?!? \u00a0I DO!!!\" \u00a0 I would - - with you, of course, and thank you for sharing this experience with me.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Chris M.", "time": "1/8/2015"}, {"content": "I consider myself very lucky to have bought a house walking distance from this place. \u00a0Everything is soooooo good but my favorite is to get the Fetoosh salad topped with chicken kabob, so heavenly and refreshing!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Amber J.", "time": "9/2/2016"}, {"content": "The best bakery in LA (soon to be OC).

The lovely Melody rang my grandmum up and she sure changed my mind about this place! The last time I went to the Glendale location I HATED IT. Guess what there was a line here too..

And it sure made my grand mums day. \u00a0I bought pastries I didn't even need haha She was so nice and even though there was so much going on she took the time out to explain and answer the questions we had about food we never tried. We went on to visit a few more times but I didn't get to see her. I never got to tip here since we didn't have cash.. If you ever get lucky enough to get her. Please say hello!

I love the cheeserolls, potato balls, and the turkey croissant sandwiches. The coffee is very good, much better than Starbucks thats for sure. Everything about this place is better than starbucks. Well except they don't have wifi so hard to camp out and do your work like people do at Starbucks, but then this place is so crowded and loved, they'd lose a lot of customers if they had people camping out like at Starbucks. I see a lot of the same people have been working there for a long time, so it appears they treat their employees well, too. Just a great place overall, my only thing would be I wish they stayed open later. I am guessing they close early because it is family run, but I am sure they'd get a lot more business if they had later closing time.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Gilbert B.", "time": "9/18/2016"}, {"content": "I sincerely cannot understand the hype of this place. Coming from the east coast I am used to New York style bakeries. The strawberry shortcake tastes like defrosted garbage. The cake was dry as a bone and the bottom layer dunked in simple syrup (barf). The whipped cream tastes artificial as ever. The apple strudel half decent though not as crispy on the outside as one would like. The potato ball, which was what most of the review hypes are about was half decent but nothing I'd come back for.
