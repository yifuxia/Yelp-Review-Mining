The one on your right will be for the bakery, the one on the left for sandwiches, salads, etc.Each section has it's own counter and wrap-around line, kind of like a parallel universe with the advantage that you can get coffee on both sides.Even though the lines looked ghastly long upon entry, they moved at lightning speed. This place knows how to move people and food quickly and efficiently.Once up to the front I picked my sandwich from the menu on the wall, took a number on a stand, went and filled my drink and was glad to find ample seating outside on the sidewalk. \u00a0Somehow Portos was able to line tables all along half a city block. It was great to sit in the shade by the trees with a breeze except for the occasional dry leaves that would dive bomb the table at surprising speeds. Within just a few minutes my sandwich arrived. \"Papa Preparado\" potato balls (basically seasoned mashed potatoes), sliced cheese, mustard, tomato, lettuce, on a crispy white baguette.After seeing how amazingly reasonable the sandwich was ($4.25), I ordered a fruit salad. The fruit salad comes in a tall plastic starbucks style container with a rounded lid and is quite large. ($2.85). It consisted of the same fruit that you'll find on Portos famous fruit tarts - Blueberries, pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, mango, and grapes.One interesting thing about sitting outside is that apparently people use the tables for clandestine meetings. There were two guys behind me discussing how to \"blend in\" and how to 'brown bag\" it (his beer I assumed then, but it also could have been lunch) and so and so, so that it looks like you're a customer.

Portos is just one of those magical places in LA where you'll find amazing food.Everything here is baked fresh and comes at a decent price. I'm a diabetic and I will risk my life enjoying their sweets and pastries. The cheese rolls are what I consider their signature item but they have a full service bakery with everything from little fruit tarts to cakes to bread.If the cheese rolls are the dessert, then their various sandwiches would be the main course. However, before getting to the main course you might wanna fill yourself up with an appetizer and what can be more appetizing than their potato balls.Who would have thought putting a meat filling inside some mashed potatoes and frying it would be absolutely delicious but it is. I could eat a whole box of this in one sitting and while I'm ashamed to admit this, I actually have come close. I've never had the pleasure but they also have the potato ball sandwich...I'll save that for another visit.I've come here many times for breakfast and while it's pretty busy, it's a nice place to sit and enjoy a couple cheese rolls, a cup of coffee, and some of their breakfast offerings. I suggest the ham, cheese, and egg croissant sandwich. It's got a Cuban twist on it cause they add a bit of mustard which makes it surprisingly better than it would without it. The coffee bar isn't anything like a Starbucks but they offer good quality coffee and what more can you really ask for while you enjoy some fresh baked pastries in the morning?", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Marion S.", "time": "11/15/2008"}, {"content": "Portos..........they need to put one in every city.

I stopped by for certain occasions like birthdays for special orders. It's conveniently located in the intersection of Magnolia Bl. and Hollywood Way. Parking is limited and the line is quite long at times. The price ranges from moderate to pricey. I've only tried a few things here like cheese roll, which is 70 cents a piece, strawberry short cake and fruit tart, which is $2.50 a piece, pricey for a tiny tart. The place is clean and simple, just enough seatings if you decide to eat in. The service is quite good for a fast pace restaurant. Staff members are accommodating and quick with your orders. Ordered 8 inch fruit cake for a birthday and it fed about 10 people for only $15. It's a great place to try if you like baked goods or need to make special orders for special occasions.
