But there is also a steak torte that is delicious. Of course you can't pass up the pastries. I recommend getting something to go since you will be full from your sandwich.

I applaud the owners for arranging orderliness because years ago it used to be a crazy mess to get in and out of the highly popular Cuban Bakery. But someone has gotten their act together and I am happy to report that the Burbank location is rather simple to get in and out of. This is good news for potato ball lovers like me. As one of the best things on earth, potato balls are delectable, amazing and irritatingly good. I say irritating because they can't be the healthiest things in the world yet every time I go to Porto's I just can't have one. I try and stop myself at two but then I find myself eating three or four.
