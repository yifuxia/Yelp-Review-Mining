Both for the carbs and for the carb-lovers...Ordering their cakes can be a bit frustrating because they are so busy that you're limited to pickup times, standing in lines behind lots of people during the weekends, etc. but their cakes are so freaking yummy that it's worth the crowds and the prices.And I have to recommend their mango-mousse cake - YYYUUUUUMMMMMYYYYY!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Debbi P.", "time": "8/11/2009"}, {"content": "This one is simple. Their Pork Sandwhich is off the hook! That's it haha. The lines and the baked bread is alright to be honest.

I probably gained weight just going over their menu. Surprisingly the chicken croquette was my favorite. I can't even explained this little ball of yumminess so just get it. You wont be disappointed. I got several selections for my staff to have their own private Porto tasting here in Sacramento. The favorites were the cheese rolls, cheese rolls with guava, the rustic apple tart, lemon poppy seed cake, and any of their cupcakes. Its something about their butter cream frosting that will have you wanting more. I'm so glad one of my employees went to L.A. to bring all of this back for our tasting party. Talk about brownie points. Everything we ordered was great. We had some of everything from Cuban sandwiches, pastries, cakes, tarts, and out of all of that those little chicken croquettes has me trying to fit a trip down to Burbank in my schedule.

A giant, tan building with Portos written in large dark letter on the top made it \u00a0easy to find.... Or maybe it was the large crowd and line out the door... I'm not too sure but man was I surprised. We went in and waited about fifteen minutes before we could even look at the pastries in the display case. I have to admit, the service was quick and efficient despite being completely packed. We ordered 2 potato balls, a banana nut muffin, and a guava and cheese strudel. The potato ball was a delicious ball of deliciousness. Crunchy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. I love the guava and cheese strudel. It was flaky and you could really taste the guava.
