[{"content": "It took me about 20 minutes to get a Ham & Cheese croissant and an iced white mocha. There were no seats left for eating in so I took it to go. This place gets so crowded \u00a0(like, \"Black Friday in a bad way\" crowded) over the weekend. Indeed, I was skeptical until I bit into the Ham and Cheese croissant on my way out of the place... and it was the best I had ever tasted! Totally worth the wait. The staff was friendly considering how busy it was in there. Getting into the right line can be a little confusing at first too. All that aside, I'll definitely be back here soon to try out their breakfast offerings.Some advice: If you're not a fan of crowds and actually like to sit down in the establishment to enjoy your food (like me), don't come here on the weekend. This place is probably great for weekday lunches if you're close by.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Isidoro A.", "time": "7/2/2008"}, {"content": "Are you allowed to fall in love with a pastry? Can you actually exchange vows and marry it? This is how I feel when I visit this place and select my personal fav: the Guava pastry. If you want to win someone's heart... you need to only take them to this amazing bakery. For the savory folks, I would say go with the potato balls... even the potato ball sandwich is delish!
