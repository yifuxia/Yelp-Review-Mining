Inexpensive, delicious, great service. Sure, you have to wait in line, but usually, it goes by very quickly. Sandwiches are great... I suggest the Cubano, Medianoche, Porto's Veggie (yum!), Pastrami, or the Pan Con Lechon. All the sandwiches come with their yummy plantain chips, too. They also have the best tortilla soup I have EVER had. Obviously, they have great pastries... I'm a fan of the fruit tart, the mango mousse, and the creme brulee (the flan and tres leches cake are very good, also). Also, they have great cookies and brownies! I would also say that you should try one of their smoothies... the mango smoothie tastes like you are biting into a mango.It seems that the Porto family has an affinity for guava, so I would definitely try their guava pastries (I know that guava and cheese sounds weird, but it tastes great) and their guava smoothie. Finally, the ham croquettes and potato balls are so yummy!You can eat a feast for under ten dollars there, no joke.Suggestion: for lunch, go around 11:30, because it's won't be too crowded.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jennifer C.", "time": "6/13/2008"}, {"content": "Usually in our modern world significantly long lines are a sign of a good thing, disregarding Tickle-Me-Elmo and the motion picture Titanic.
