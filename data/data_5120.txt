EVERYONE should try their potato balls! Their fruit tart was a bit dried and according to my cousin, their fruit tart is made different than the other Porto's.

Pretty much any sandwich you get here is pretty yummy. And there pastries? To die for! I've only ordered one cake, and to be honest, I've had better. The cake itself was very soft and moist, but there was entirely too much frosting, and the \"fresh\" strawberries had that artificial goo all over them. HOWEVER, I did go to the Porto's in Downey rather than the Porto's in Burbank. If you're also wondering why I rated this place a \"two dollar rating,\" it's not because their pricey. It's because once you get in there and are showcased the massive amounts of pastries, cakes and other sweets, you're going to have a panic attack and vomit out an order as long as you waited in line to get to the cash register.FYI: I've heard that the Porto's to go to to order a specialty cake and really get your money's worth is the one in Pasadena. I've yet to try anything from there because the line to order is always 14 blocks long, but I'll get in there one day!Try their coconut strudel or their guava cheese strudel.
