[{"content": "One of my favorite sandwich places!!I love sandwiches, and it is soo refreshing to find a place with this much variety of breads/meats/sandwiches and desserts! Also, their sandwiches are not greasy and heavy, but rather they are filling but still make you feel light! They come with these great banana chips on the side! I had the grilled chicken sandwich, and it was SO yummy!Their desserts are spectacular also--so much to choose from!

I love the way your fruit tart is filled with the most beautiful, fresh fruit that's just perfectly sweet. \u00a0And sometimes right after payment, nothing can beat your warm, perfectly spiced chicken empanadas. \u00a0What I love about you the most is how all of these benefits comes for such a great value.

The biggest surprise was the variety of latin sodas including Inca Kola, very hard to find in supermarkets here. \u00a0The only setback to Porto's is the line to order eat in or take out. \u00a0Being busy shouldn't be seen as a negative, but I know some friends who get impatient when hungry so the wait would bother them.

There can be long lines though, especially peak times, but the service is quick and efficient. Finding parking can be a headache at times as well.

We've also tried the cheesecake, brownies, cookies, and carrot cake, and it was all fresh and delicious. And holy heck everything is so CHEAP!Negatives? The separate lines for everything and the general chaos inside. I really wanted to try a sandwich but we only managed to find a 10 minute parking space. It took 20 minutes just to get through the bakery line. No way I was going to spend another half hour in line for the sandwich.
