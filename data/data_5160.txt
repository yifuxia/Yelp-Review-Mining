[{"content": "I LOVE this place. I'm so glad they finally put one up in Burbank, which is basically a hop, skip and jump away. Indeed, it doesn't need anymore reviews. I have tried the following there: bluberry muffin, carrot/apple muffin (in fact ALL their muffins), \"quesadilla\" bread, tres leches, italian cheesecake, the cuban sandwich, potato ball sandwich, potato balls, sweet fried plantain stuffed w/ black beans (it's odd I know - but yummy), mango cheesecake, mango mousse, OF COURSE the CHEESE ROLLS, fruit tart, guava/cheese rolls, lemon poppyseed bundt cake, dulce de leche bundt cake, \u00a0new york cheesecake,flourless chocolate cake (which is the only thing I did not like so far)pineapple empanada,mango empanada,spinach/feta cheese croissant,fruit bowl,banana chips w/ sauce,and I think that's all I can remember... Don't be silly - I didn't eat all of that at one time. These are the things I have had from that place since it opened in Burbank. What first got me hooked was the cheese rolls. They also have single-serving sizes of the whole cakes if you want to try them. The staff has always been friendly to me, and I have not been unsatisfied w/ any of my purchases (well - except for that flourless chocolate cake). EVERYTIME I go in there and am in awe of their presentation of their products. It looks very organized and clean. Plus I can never decide which one I want to try next. Sometimes I debate on sticking with what I know or trying something new...so I end up doing both. LOL... not good for my diet. Check it out. The line usually goes pretty fast, and if it doesn't - that's time I usually spend looking at the display to decide what I want :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Pauline M.", "time": "4/13/2008"}, {"content": "I love \u00a0their guava/cheese troussel but the rest is mediocre. \u00a0their cakes- waaay too sweet for me.There was a fly trapped inside their glass case, the guy behind the counter was really slow in getting someone to get that fly out of there, he didnt even care. \u00a0When I asked for the 'fresh' stuff from the back (coz the ones in the glass case are totally gross now) he smirked at me and said, these are fly-free honey. \u00a0WTF?", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "lisa l.", "time": "8/28/2008"}, {"content": "I really like Porto's. \u00a0It's great food AND pretty cheap. \u00a0TONs of pastries to choose from, I always make an effort to try a new one each time. \u00a0The only downside is trying to get a table around lunch time.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Richard W.", "time": "8/24/2011"}, {"content": "Ok, I know reviewing something that has over 1200 reviews is kind of like beating a dead horse, but whatever...it was THAT GOOD that I still have to review it.

I called 3 times to order a cake, was in the store for 2 hours and was given different price quotes each time. The manager Fernando kept telling me that Maria, the incompetent pre-order manager new what she was talking about and WOULD NOT acknowledge that she gave me the wrong price. Eventually I got fed up and sent my husband to deal with them - they told him they were giving him a good deal and charged him EVEN MORE than they had quoted me in the last conversation with Fernando. MISERABLE! Then Fernando tells me \"we don't discount our cakes,\" Well then give me the correct price the first time! Oddly enough when we picked up the catering order ($400 of food) they conveniently forgot to add olives - I didn't get a discount for this, while they want to charge me extra to add fruit to my cake. The service is miserable. The staff and managers are clueless and unhelpful, it took my husband 1 hour to pick up our catering order because they forgot to heat it ahead of time, so the food (and my husband) arrived 30 mins late to the party.

I was in debate over 4 stars or five. I decided to do four because as good as Porto's is, there are some glitches to their operating system (one dorky computer joke).Now, I can honestly say that as far as \"bang for your buck\" goes, there is no better place to go than Porto's. Seriously, you can get a sandwich and a drink for about $6, and I'm not talking about some nasty sandwich, I'm talking about a GOOOOOOD sandwich. I have been here numerous times. Every time is just as good as the last. So they have consistency. The service is ok, and I would definitely say that there is where they lose a star. Their system of ordering is really flawed. Really flawed. It's weird: you order your food from one guy, then you watch him tell the cashier what you ordered and then you pay the cashier. Why not cut out the middle man? Or why not make the middle man a cashier as well? That would make things perfect. Now, they have a list of sides there, like Potato Balls and some other like items. They are each $1 or less. I suggest (highly suggest) ordering all of them. Those are where it's at. Mmmmmmm! And also: the pastries are delicious. Get a Napoleon. That little effer is the best damn thing since sliced bread.

I've been bugging my coworkers to go to lunch there for the past month but they never listen to me. But, after going to Subway for the third weekend in a row, I realized I had to take matters into my own hands. I was a woman on a mission, and that mission was to get as much Porto's as I could eat and enjoy it in front of my coworkers to show them what they've missed.If I had any qualms about spiting my fellow colleagues, those thoughts went away when I walked through the front sliding doors and realized what they had been depriving me of. As I walked in, the large glass display cases called my name, asking to be purchased and eaten, cheering that I finally made it to the fooding grounds.Porto's is a world of pastries and magic. Fantastically yummy creations as far as the eye can see! The variety of pastries alone took my breath away. How could I choose what to eat?I started my order with breakfast. I ordered a quacamole omelette on a croissant and a guava cheese pastry. Man, was that sandwich big - for four dollars, that was a great buy. The guac was fresh, there was tons of egg and the croissant was buttery but light. Fantastic. The guava pastry...well...let me just say this. My plan was to take everything to go - that pastry never made it to the car.Next, I ordered lunch to eat later in the day. I've got to get a handful of those potato balls that everyone raves about and...oh god, they're as good as people say they are. I should have ordered more instead of getting this cubano sandwich (I didn't even touch my cubano, I had so much food in my face already). Let's end the order with one of those tiny tres leches cakes what do I have? I've got a sugar high to last me the rest of the day.I went to Porto's with a mission. I left Porto's with two big bags of food (for less than $15!) and some puff pastry stuck to my face. Then I drove to the office and stuffed my face while others munched on their lifeless Subway sandwiches.What? You want some potato balls? Too bad.
