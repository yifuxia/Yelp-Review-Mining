Although I make it sound dramatic (which definitely deserves it), the line actually isn't that long of a wait either. They have SO many different types of pastries and cakes, but of course, I am a mad fan of their CHEESE ROLLS. I can't get enough of their cheese rolls--they're the perfect mix of slight saltiness from the cheese mixed with the sweet goodness of the pastry. Every time I get these cheese rolls, I can't wait until I get home to eat them, so I end up eating one or two in my car, while still parked in their parking lot.Their parking lot has a 2- or 1- hour limit, and it's restricted to Porto's customers only. It's a pretty sizable lot, so you should be able to find parking within 10 minutes at most. The inside, however, is very crowded and I feel like it will be a struggle to find a table (if you decide to eat there), although I can't say for sure because I've never dined in there.I will definitely be back for their cheese rolls.

However, they handle customers in the most efficient way that I am always surprised at how quickly the lines move. Because they are always busy, baked goods and cakes are kept fresh. It's impressive how efficient, neat, and clean they maintain the store given the large number of endless customers.

The pride they show at their work is remarkable.His service is superb and the leadership that he shows among his colleagues shows the experience and the quality of work he delivers at all times.
