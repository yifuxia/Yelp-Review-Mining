[{"content": "Best bakery in LA. Bar none. I'm more of a savory person, so I go for the potato balls and chicken croquettes. Their cubano sandwiches are also on point. But their sweets are all outstanding. They are famous for their cheese rolls, and at $7.00 for a dozen, its a deal you can't beat. Don't be put off by the huge waiting line when you enter. There is always a line and it always moves pretty fast.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Amber C.", "time": "3/3/2016"}, {"content": "Love love love this place. It's a little scary your first visit. Long lines but they always move quickly but when it's your turn and you don't know the menu and there's all these beautiful items enticing you through the showcase it's a bit unnerving. You want to point to everything and have one of each! The staff is always helpful though and understand when you don't have your act together. You order your goods first and your drinks later. Then you go to the end to wait to pay and get your box of goodies. Next you go to a drink pick up area. Lastly, you try to find somewhere to sit. I saw other people with numbers for plated foods. There's also lines for cake pick up. I'm still a novice. Been 3 times, but always a great experience! There was even a line when it there was a huge rainstorm! Everyone's addicted! Lol.

However, the parking situation, service, and lack of direction ruins this place for me. I would definitely come here more often, but I don't want to have to deal with major stress of just getting food. We live in Los Angeles, not New York. There are people frequently standing around lost, confused, and in your way! Clearly they need a bigger location or at least some people out on the floor to guide the frequent traffic of customers.

I mean do you want 10 dozens of each? I'm usually in and out in less than 15 min. Management is great and staff always friendly to give you the Porto's love. I really have no complaints about this place. I think a membership or loyalty card would be awesome. I suggest: Buy 6 drinks get the 7th drip for free ...

Honestly people how else do you think \u00a0a company can stay afloat with massive demand and a low price point? Through dirt cheap labor. Take a look at the individuals who are in \"management\" most if not all can barely speak English. Employees are obviously overwhelmed from working long hours for pennies and no benefits. It's honestly a tragedy. I usually just go in for Birthday Cakes and always leave feeling dirty. But i know what i'm paying for and what to expect. If you want better service tip they always remember who tips and they will treat you better. In reality even though the lines are out the door and you may think they make a small \u00a0fortune in tips, 98% of customer do not tip.

It's so creamy and sweet from the mango.The only thing I didn't like was their tres leches... It was really gummy textured.Their freshly squeezed oj is great. Their mango smoothie is really good too!

I ordered the one that has cranberries, caramelized peacan and feta cheese. It tastes amazing!Soup: NOT VEGETARIAN! I was VERY upset about it, I ate their black bean soup twice, without knowing that had meat broth in it. The first time I got it I asked the guy (who is clearly clueless and trying to get rid of me as soon as possible because of the huge line behind me). So I ate this shit twice. It tastes fine, if you are nor vegetarian, go for it! It is small though. Sandwiches: Only 1 vegetarian option. When you ask to replace the bread for a healthier option they have only one: Whole wheat. It does not look atractive at all! I did not order the sandwich.
