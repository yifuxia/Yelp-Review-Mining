You can see it when you circle around looking for parking. You question, \"is it worth it? Is it really worth circling again to find a spot?\" Yes. Yes it is. Unless of course, you are on a lunch break and in a hurry. Porto's has a line for a reason and that reason is Porto Balls (that now come Vegetarian, God bless America). Who doesn't love seasoned meat (or pepper jack) rolled up inside potatoes and deep fried to a golden brown?Their sandwiches are good too... very good. And those weird looking fries that taste suspiciously good though they look like they were ran over by a semi on the 34? Those are plantain chips and they may just change your life. Feeling like cheating your fad/crash/sensible new diet? Check out their bakery and I dare you to tell me that waiting in not one, but TWO lines wasn't worth it when you taste their desserts.

Like, it's a must. I'm from Northern California and every single time I am down here, I must stop by and pick up a huge box of cheese rolls and potato balls. The line speaks for itself. It is worth the hype. WORTH IT. People come from all over to get Porto's because of their famous cheese rolls at an affordable price of $0.70 per roll. Some of my other favorites include the Guava Cheese Roll, Potato Balls and Chicken Croquettes. MMMMM I need moar!!!My favorite thing about this place is the line goes by super quickly because they have so many people working. Also, you can sample anything in their bakery. And I mean anything. When I came here the first time, I wasn't sure what I wanted to buy so the server suggested the Guava Cheese Roll. When she provided me a sample, I expected it to be cut up and in smaller pieces. She literally gave me the entire Guava Cheese Roll. And she did not add it to my tab. How nice is that? Obviously don't go crazy with your samples...but it was just really cool for them to do that. I really wish they open one in Northern California soon because I dislike having to carry 3-4 boxes of pastries to deliver to family and friends every single time I come here.
