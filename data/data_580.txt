Next time Downey so the collection is complete. There's parking in the back and front which is essential since everyone wants a piece of that Portos. Just as I expected, long lines but they were very fast about it. I feel like I was in and out within minutes. The workers are very nice, patient and have the most amazing memory. I wanted cheese rolls, potato balls, eclair, guava and cheese roll, tres leche cake, horchata smoothie, mango smoothie and more. They didn't even miss one! So far each Portos tastes the same. I haven't dined in and tried the cafe food yet. I'm definitely curious about their Cuban sandwiches. The Porto's family story is very inspiring and I am happy the family is achieving the American Dream and I'm more than happy to be helping them by being a recurring customer. I wonder if they have plans to expand up north and open one in the Bay Area? I only get to eat Portos when I travel down south and that's seldom. A few years ago the cheese roll at the Glendale location was $0.70. This location now (2016) is $0.75. Is this location more expensive or have the prices gone up over the years? I'm okay with paying $0.75 for a cheese roll because it's damn good. Portos is one of those must go to places when you're in SoCal. Every pastry I've eaten I love and is freakin good. I've shared some with friends and they are in love as well. I love Portos!!! I can't get enough!!!

I ended up getting a dozen of the guava cheese rolls, 6 guava strudels, and 6 cheese rolls. All of this cost about $18-- a great alternative to donuts. The pastries are really delicious, and at a great price for about 80 cents a piece. Hint: you get a \u00a0small discount when you buy by the dozen, but you just save a few cents.I also like their sandwiches and other items, but haven't tried them at this location (I used to live by the Glendale site). I'm sure they are good here too.This a great place to try if you're in the area. The lines get long, but move fast.

Seasoned mashed potatoes inside a pastry.The guava strudel has that subtle taste of guava and if you're a fan of guava, you will love it.Their cheese rolls are sweet and lovely if you're into cheese. (Who isn't?)Their steak torta was not flavorful at all. That one is not recommended. (For carne asada torta, look up King Taco.)They also have dulce de leche baked in tin foil for $6.50. It's mushy and soggy but delicious. (The presentation sucks but it's so rich and buttery.)Their chicken empanadas have barely any bits of chicken but is also one of their best creations.Their fruit tarts are half the cost of cake for the same size, and I personally love them. A friend of mine complained that it's still expensive considering that all of the fruits they use are canned, not fresh, but it's still the best fruit tart money can buy. People keep saying this place is priced right, but I always leave having spent at least $30. Those long lines motivate everyone to buy more than they need, so keep that in mind. I've thrown away a lot of their pastry because I couldn't find people to eat them. It's so delicious, but people in LA are vain.

We decided to have lunch at the cafe on a Thursday in March, and it was packed. We got lucky and found a parking spot in the back lot. A man greeted us at the door, gave us a menu, and told us we can go in either of the two lines. We went to the left. We were in line for about 30 minutes. We ordered our pastries to go and got those right away. And it took about 25 minutes for us to get our lunch. \u00a0We ordered the Caprese Sandwich ($6.98) and the Feta Sandwich.($4.65). Both came with plantain banana chips. Both sandwich tastes great, but it was difficult to eat the Caprese sandwich with thick slices of tomatoes. The tomatoes kept falling off. Also, it was supposed to be on a French baguette like the Feta sandwich, but it looked like it was on a different type of bread that was more of a roll than a baguette. The Feta sandwich had a lot of feta in it, and was a little dry. It was supposed to have Italian dressing, but I'm not sure if there was any.The best was our guava cheese pastries ($0.90 cents)!

First it was the attitude then she took a very long time attending us as she did two people at once, then she didn't even get our order right the first time the second time it came close but not everything we paid for was in our box. She went back to get our pastries with an attitude as if it was our fault. None the less we still didn't get our complete order. It really sucks when employees are like that, we get it's busy and it's hectic but if you're feeling the pressure then take a break or have someone help with you. Don't just take it out on the customers that had nothing to do with it. My wife and I are from San Diego and everything we go to LA we make a stop at Portos, but this specific time was the worst.
