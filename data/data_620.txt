[{"content": "I've probably had Portos about a dozen times, delivered by my awesome friends, but never had it fresh from the bakery. Living in Norcal is tough haha. This time I can finally write a review after going to the bakery. This place appears super busy and the lines are long. BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED! Their employees are trained for this, so the lines move fast! It's just another day at the shop for them. I walked out with two dozen cheese rolls and a dulce de leche latte. Soooo good! I stopped feeling bad for ordering two dozen after I saw someone walking out with mutiple boxes on a cart lol.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Will N.", "time": "11/14/2015"}, {"content": "THE BEST POTATO BALLS & CHEESE ROLLS! If they had this place in the Bay Area, I'll be all over it! But too bad it's only in So Cal. ):My cousin, friends & I waited a cool 10 minute outside but it's only for safety concerns so no one get trampled on while waiting in line outside. They were great with keeping organized & splitting the lines into 2 on each side of the store since it's so big. Waiting again for the line inside but it wasn't bad at all! We went crazy & bought 3 boxes of pastries & drove all the way home to Nor Cal to share with friends & family. We need Porto's in the Bay Area.

They are usually full but I go in the mornings around 7am and it's a fast! It all depends what day you go weekends and holidays are obviously going to be busy! But they have the Guava and Cheese Bread which is my favorite. They also have a just Guava in case you can't eat the cheese. They're potato balls, breakfast omelette ham and cheese, ham croquettes, spinach feta bread, grilled chicken sandwiches, tres leches, cheesecakes are awesome!!!!!! You need to try everything and you will see what I am talking about. I think some cakes are pretty basic but tres leches I love it because it's not to sweet and not to flavorless it's just right. Cheesecakes are really good have a good flavor. Cheese rolls also another great invention!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Josephine M.", "time": "4/12/2016"}, {"content": "Portos is a must visit bakery and sandwich shop when in the area. The lines look long but they move incredibly fast. Don't forget the strawberry smoothie w/ whip cream. Their sandwiches are much better than most places and Portos is 1/2 the price you expect to pay. Their prices are more than reasonable. Oh yeah. The coffee is absolutely perfect. Deserts are tops tops tops. The one negative point is the parking. Their always so busy, it's hard to park in their lot. Try street parking and you'll be happier.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Tom R.", "time": "3/27/2016"}, {"content": "Long lines!

So good", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Vanessa T.", "time": "3/8/2016"}, {"content": "It's true. This place is in fact as good as everyone says. I can't believe that food this good is priced so low. Things I've tried and loved: * the Cubano sandwich: it's BIG. And delicious. And the leftovers are delicious too.* the strawberry-banana shake: I usually dislike this flavor combo in shakes, but Porto's version was delicious.* The chicken croquettes: soooo gooood. Crunchy outside. Melting inside. All the flavor.* the tres leches cake: I'm super-picky about them and haven't had a decent one since I left NYC many years ago. But Porto's nails it. Their version is just sweet enough to be addictive but not so sweet as to be cloying. After I post this review, I'm going over to get myself another one.And now a random and slightly loopy interlude: I was surprised when I ordered an orange juice and it was room temp. I thought about it: it's fresh-squeezed, so obviously it's not going to be cold, right? But room-temp OJ was kinda weird, not gonna lie. Next time I'll ask for just a little ice, just enough to cool it without diluting it much. But all that said, I really did like the flavor. I mean, fresh-squeezed OJ. Duh. //end interludeSo! Go. Don't let the lines dismay you and don't be cranky. Take a book or something and relax. Good things come to those who wait.

Long line but is worth the wait. Don't be discouraged line actually moves pretty fast.My favorite dish is ropa vieja, I also loved \u00a0 the potato balls and Mariquitas (sliced plantain chips) We ordered carns asada tortas as well as two other dinner plates grilled chicken and carne asada plates. Neither one of the previous mentioned had the homemade taste to them, presentation could also in my opinion use a little improvement as the amount of beans on the plate outnumber anything else in it, plus they were too runny.We were lucky enough to get out hand on a couple of tres leches desserts but to our disappointment they were extremely sweet!!!Guava rolls and cheese rolls were really good.Also beware of the amount on your receipt.I was overcharged for the dinner plates meaning the amount on my receipt was not the same listed on the board there were no extras added.Also I do understand we are in a drought and that's why they charge 50 cents for cup of water?Overall very good place for snacks and desserts, we ll be back next time in the area.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Imelda G.", "time": "11/25/2015"}, {"content": "This place.
