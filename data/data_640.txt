But word of advice to management - update your holiday hours!Aside from the above, we went again the next day because my daughter wanted to share the foodie experience with me (though I am currently on a quest to fit into a size six mother of the Bride dress!)

At this point they have been there for an hour...hungry toddler is going nuclear...so my husband just left. At a certain point when you lose a customer's order you should make it you high priority to get it to them...especially if you see the have a baby aka ticking time bomb.

Fast forward to when I was at a pizza place across the street, I realized I wasn't in the mood for pizza. I warily eyed Porto's across the street and figured I'd try it now since it was right across the way. Big mistake was that I realized it was the Friday before Mother's Day weekend. Entering, I was at a crossroads: to my left was a fairly long line, and as I glanced to my right, the line seemed double in size. Thankfully, there was a hostess there to guide me to the left line. This line was somewhat welcoming as I scanned their menu to see what I was hungry for. A couple things caught my eye (turkey croissant sandwich and chicken dinner plate) then between the sea of people, I saw a piece of strawberry shortcake looking at me. I went ahead and placed an order for all three, pleasantly surprised that this order didn't even top $17. Anywhere else, I would have been in the $20 range, but I wasn't aware that Porto's was so affordable. I just kept hearing how good it was. This was a much added bonus to my day. Let me tell you that chicken dinner plate (I only had rice instead of the other sides offered) was amazing. Considering they seem to be known for their bakery, this plate was full of flavor, and highly satisfying. The turkey sandwich was good, and the strawberry shortcake took me two days to finish. When I return, it will be for that dinner plate for sure. Finally took me this long to try Porto's Bakery & Cafe, but I'm so glad I did. According to others, I must try these potato balls.

This also means that I frequent Porto's Bakery. Whether getting pastries or potato balls to go, or eating in, particularly for breakfast, Porto's is an absolute must if you are in Burbank.At Porto's you get in line (which can be quite long depending on the day and time) and eventually make it to the counter to place your order. The pastries display is massive, and Porto's features pastries, cakes, pies, cookies, and many more delicious temptations. On this day I got a fairly large to go order: Potato Balls, a couple each of Pineapple & Cheese Danish, Chocolate Croissant, Apricot Danish, Pear Danish, and Strawberry & Cheese Croissant, Strawberry and Chocolate cupcakes, Opera individual cake slices, and Carrot Cake individual slices. The Potato Balls are as good as everyone says they are. When taking them home, I advise warming them up either in a toaster oven or using the broil setting in a standard oven. They are absolutely delicious and deceptively filling, with a crispy outside and a gooey inside with perfectly seasoned ground beef. And at 90 cents a pop, grabbing 1 or even 2 dozen is pretty easy to do. These alone make a trip to Porto's worth it.The pastries are very soft and fresh and oh so good. The Pineapple & Cheese is my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of their croissants or Danishes. Both cake slices were amazing. I am picky with carrot cake, and though this isn't the best one I have ever had, it was very good, with great cream cheese frosting and a delicious cake portion. The opera was also very well done and had the right amount of coffee flavor. I will call out that the cupcakes were nothing fantastic, and I would not get them again. I have never had the cookies here but hear they are also great, and the flan is also delicious.Even though the main attraction is the bakery, you can actually eat hot food here, too. I didn't on this occasion but have had breakfast in the past. The Chorizo breakfast sandwich is amazing and highly recommended, and it pairs nicely with a Danish or croissant. Porto's also has a full barista style drink menu. I am not a coffee drinker, but they have many other options. I particularly like the mango smoothie.As good as the food is, the prices are even better. Everything here is amazingly cheap. As an example, compare both the price and quality of any individual pastry you get here with what you would get at a Starbucks. You will pay twice as much at Starbucks and not get as high of quality or quantity. I am constantly amazed how far my money stretches when I am here, which generally means I leave with way more than I originally intended! The service is top notch and super efficient, and the food is so good. Don't let the long lines scare you.

Before our hike, my friend recommended we went to porto's to grab some quick to-go lunch. We got there and the line wasn't too bad, after ordering, the line grew longer and it got more hectic. We got the Potato balls, guava pastry, guava and cheese pastry, the turkey croissant, and the horchata drink. We got full off of the potato balls alone so we saved the guava pastries and turkey croissant. The potato balls were really good. It was crispy on the outside, but not overly greasy or soggy. The inside was a soft mashed potato consistency with seasoned ground meat enveloped in the center of it all. The meat inside tasted like there was some bell peppers in there. Kinda Spanish flavors? Idk but it was good. The guava pastries were flaky and the filling was nice and jammy. I could definitely taste the guava and it wasn't too sweet at all, which I liked. The horchata however was a little too sweet for me but my friends loved it. I think the highly recommended items here are the tres leches, the guava pastries, and the potato balls. Those are a must. But I'm sure everything here is great. It's just hectic all the time and at one point There was confusion and some miscommunication with one of the workers getting my order. The busy atmosphere didn't help with the confusion but we got the order straightened out in the end. Just make sure you know exactly what you want. I didn't realize there was a (guava pastry) and a (guava+cheese pastry). I thought it was just cheese so me and the lady got mixed up.
