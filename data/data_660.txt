[{"content": "In my opinion, customer service is just as important as the food itself. I can't begin to tell you how many times I've placed custom cake orders and they've consistently come out wrong. I've had to stand there for up to a half an hour waiting on them to correct the item I've ordered. Yes, the food is fantastic, sometimes even amazing, but, when you have to stand there with your \u00a0order in hand with all the instructions they did not follow on it, it makes it tough for me to want to go back and be a customer. If you're just going to the counter and buying something pre made, you're in luck. If you're going to the order counter to place a special cake order...you're doomed.", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "name": "The Last Honest Reviewer ..", "time": "6/18/2016"}, {"content": "Mango mousseTiramisuCreme br\u00fbl\u00e9e Red velvet Lemon poppy seedCrowded with very long lines.

EXCELLENT!!!!! WELL PRICED!!!! SCRUMPTIOUS!!! ADDICTING!!!!! These are just the tip of the iceberg.We take every person that comes to visit us in Burbank to this place and without fail... it has been their favorite food stop on the trip. Not the expensive candle lit dinner or the amazing beach restaurant with a view. It has been PORTO's. Why? I think because you feel like you have found a secret. How could something taste so good and be priced so well in Los Angeles? You feel like you are getting a fantastic return on your investment.There is a reason this place is constantly packed. But don't let the lines detour you!!!! They do very well at managing the wait and keeping things moving. Well worth your time and money. I haven't eaten a thing here I have not loved.

It's a fantastic place to bring visitors.My family still raves about it and they don't live here. It doesn't break the bank. A few potato balls are hardly a couple dollars and it's a solid heavy meal when you're broke.Porto's is definitely a great place to start if you don't know where to go in Burbank and expect to wait in line unless you go close to closing hours.Horchata over ice is my favorite drink though most (including this) are very sweet. The chicken caesar and turkey croissant with avocado are my favorite savory options. Guava cheese pastry, bocado de principe (cinnamon sponge cake,) powdered sugar cream puffs (white and yellow cream,) and their tres leches (milk'n'berries version) are my favorite sweets.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "R.

I grew up going to the Glendale location but started visiting their Burbank location every time my family stops by Burbank. Prices are extremely reasonable and pastries/food/drinks are always great! My favorite pastries are their Cheese Rolls, Guava & Cheese Rolls, and their Potato Balls. They're so amazing that I've flown them up to NorCal a few times! (Yes, I'm that girl waiting at Bob Hope airport with 1-2 bags of Porto's but it's so worth it!) Their fruit tart is soooo good as well and is absolutely LOADED with fruit. Yummmmmmmmm! As far as their sandwiches go, my favorite is their Pan con Bistec, along with their Pan con Lechon. Their other sandwiches are great as well. Thirsty for a drink? Their guava smoothies are delicious as well as their Dulce de Leche Latte! Their freshly squeezed orange juice is pretty popular too!Another perk of this location? FREE PARKING!! They have a good amount of parking in the lot and turnaround is pretty quick. There's also a good amount of free street parking as well :)", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Charlene L.", "time": "4/12/2015"}]
