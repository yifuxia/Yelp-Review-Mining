I mean, how dare I give Porto's only three stars?! So here's the thing. They have the best cafe con leche in LA, no question about it. They also have beautiful looking and tasty pastries, reasonable prices and operate in a large corner real estate spot on Burbank's happening Magnolia row. So what gives?First off, the lineup is always long whenever you go, breakfast or lunch, doesn't matter. And even when it's a shorter queue, it takes forever to get to the front, like the staff are training you for when you come back to experience a longer wait in the future. For a real lesson in the art of \"how long can you wait before losing your marbles\", come here and be patient in line. Then, while the coffee is outstanding, the pastries are unfortunately underwhelming. They're really just ok. Nothing you would crave on a regular basis. The croissants are kind of greasy and the sandwiches are good but not excellent. Ultimately, it's a unique spot to experience and I would never tell anyone not to go. In fact I would go there again and probably will when I'm in the area. But if the line is too long I'll just get back in the car and go elsewhere, especially if it's for my morning cup of joe.

Came on a Saturday morning around 8:30am and it was PACKED. Both lines were soooo long and we ended up waiting 20-25 min. We got 2 potato balls, 2 spicy potato balls, 3 cheese rolls, 1 meat pie, 1 chicken croquette, and a large dulce de leche latte. I was pretty excited because these were so reasonably priced! All the items were about $1 and the latte was $3.99, which is pretty good for the size. The potato balls are like fried balls of mashed potatoes with taco meat inside. They were pretty good but I couldn't eat too much because the fried stuff makes it feel heavy. The chicken croquette was super whatever...it kinda tastes like chicken but I didn't see any chicken inside...it also kinda looks like potatoes. The spicy potato ball was pretty good too, it was basically like a potato jalapeno popper. The meat pie was nice and flaky but not enough meat imo. The cheese rolls were nice once you realize they're supposed to be SWEET...because when I hear cheese rolls I think savory. But yes they're pretty good!
