I was so impressed on this visit, that I had 2 throw a shout out......Anthony took my order then disappeared to the kitchen, and he brought out the best looking and tasting guava pastries I've had from them, and I've bought countless dozens over the years.

Be patient, it's worth the wait. Porto's has the madness down to a science. You will be at the front of the line ordering bags of food in no time. You can never go wrong with any of their pastries. The chocolate Parisian cake and strawberry cake are to die for. If you're ordering a sandwich, do yourself a favor and order some cheese rolls to snack on while you wait. The potato balls are a must try. The sandwiches are tasty, but the bread can be a bit flaky at times. I especially enjoy that they have the Afro- Caribbean beverage, Malta.

There's three lines available. One is specifically for cakes only and the other two are for drinks and some other items and then a line for basically everything. The lines weren't too long when I came here on a Monday afternoon. There were a ton of workers available and super fast service. I was honestly a bit overwhelmed with all of my options and was worried I'd take forever choosing what I wanted, but the helper didn't make me feel rushed at all. MUST GET THE POTATO BALLS. It is absolutely delicious. I was honestly skeptical. Thinking to myself, how good could a ball of potato and meat really be? Well, let me tell you....it was magical. You have a crispy texture on the outside then the softness of the potato and then the amazing flavor of the seasoned ground beef. It was basically like Popeye's mashed potatoes (will always be my fav) rolled into a fried ball of perfection. So good. I also tried the chicken croquette, chorizo pie, cheese rolls, a cubano sandwich, and the blended horchata. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chorizo pie...the outside was a little too dry for me. Tons of butter, so it kind of stuck to the roof of my mouth too. Everything else was really good though! I love cream cheese croissants - which is what you can expect from the cheese rolls...except even better! Cubano sandwich was good as well although I wish I ate it there instead of taking it to go..the bread a little soggy by the time I got back to my friend's apt. Also, everything was priced really well! Very affordable! I brought back two boxes for home plus the sandwich and my total came out to $26.
