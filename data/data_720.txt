[{"content": "This place is huge!!!!! And the lines are super long (but I went at like 6-7pm). They have two separate lines for food food and pastries and cakes. I was there for the pastries and there were so many choices!! I also didn't have much time so I just went for the usual potato balls, cheese rolls, and guava cheese rolls. They were all fresh and delicious. The person that helped me out was also really friendly and I was going to purchase 5 of each but he informed me half a dozen would be the same price so I took his word. There's so many other things that I want to try though!

If you are first time here, just be ready to be lost for a moment. The one who got my order (whom I assumed to be a newbie) didn't \u00a0double check ours, and later we found exactly three of ours were different. I corrected one of them before I paid, but I found out two of them after we sat on the table. We didn't make it a big deal to avoid complexity, and because it was so busy there we simply understood there could be a mistake. One thing I wanted to complain though, was that we changed our order to dozen just to get it as special price, but when we were asked to choose between hot and room-temperature, he didn't let us know making it hot would change it back to normal price. But it was \u00a0our first time trying this famous bakery, and \u00a0now we have more confidence in all the process. Compared to what you would get, everything is super cheap and tasty. I also loved the way that the manager tried to be kind and hospitable to customers during all those hassles.The things \u00a0we got were very ordinary and traditional.-Potato balls (good. I loved the regular one more than spicy \u00a0one)-Cheese rolls (the best as I think)-guava& cheese strudel-ham croquette (so so)-Oreo cheesecake (you definately will need hot Americano as a supplement cuz the cheesecake alone would be way too heavy. But with coffee, it's all good)Ambience is lively and loud, but still clean and casual. I loved the lightings too.

I personally think the potato balls are overrated and not worth the calories. What's worth every calorie is their tres leches cake and their cheese rolls! Party-in-your-mouth delicious! I like that their prices are still reasonable, despite their popularity. Can't beat 75 cents a cheese roll and $15 for a tres leches cake that can feed 10. Cons: Parking! I suggest parking a few blocks away in the residential area to avoid the headache.

Literally my favorite place in the world. I go to Porto's for almost anything and everything. Cakes I have tried: Tres Leches (favorite cake in the entire world), carrot cake, red velvet, tiramisu, white chocolate raspberry, triple chocolate mouse, and cappuccino mouse. All cakes are incredible and most are huge under $25. These cakes can feed probably 20 people. Best price you could find! They even write a custom note on a piece of white chocolate for absolutely no charge!Pastries I have tried: Guava strudel, chicken stuffed potato ball, all muffins, cupcakes and chocolate croissant. If you have an event your hosting, I would recommend pre-ordering. So the day you go in to pick up, you don't have any lines and can make sure they have your cake and other things ready. They have big breakfast platters you can get for a wonderful price. If you did not pre-order and are going to stand in line, best time to go is 7 AM (basically no line and quick service).", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Jazz P.", "time": "11/4/2015"}, {"content": "Their cakes are to die for!

It always sounds like you're in a wind tunnel echo chamber when you're inside here but I've gotten used to it.The lines do move fast and they are quick to bring your food to your table.I recommend their Southwest Salad with grilled chicken which is a major home run. Their chicken Caesar salad is also great. I used to get the steak on my salads but it started tasting kinda dry each time, so I went back to the grilled chicken and it's super juicy and perfect for their salads. Other items I love are the turkey croissant, meat pies, and their home made chicken soup. The soup is a small portion but they do a great job in making it. I do wish it was bigger, but I guess I like NOT feeling like a bloated beached whale when I leave. That's a plus.Also I wish they still brewed the unsweetened green tea, which both my brother and I enjoyed. But they got rid of it early this year and replaced it with another black tea which I don't like as much.Very solid place to get a casual quick bite to eat.
