I have had pastries from here when others brought them to gatherings and always liked them and meant to come here myself, well, today was the day. But I was hungry for more than pastry so I was glad to see that there was more available than just baked goods. Standing in line trying to decide between tasty-sounding sandwiches and more substantial plates my hunger pushed me toward the plates but then to choose between chicken or Ropa Vieja (which I like a lot most places that have it) so I settled on the latter, what a great choice!Black beans and rice and Cuban plantains come with it but the Ropa Vieja itself... excellent. Now I know some will say it's too salty perhaps not spicy enough but I really enjoyed it with the olives and pimentos. The savory balanced by the blandness of the rice, the tastiness of the beans against the sweetness of the plantains. That and a tasty white chocolate mocha blended for $13 and change. Great deal.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Philip C.", "time": "6/15/2016"}, {"content": "They did my wedding cake and not only was it perfectly beautiful but wonderfully delicious!

I've never walked into Porto's Bakery when it's not busy, but what I like about this particular location is that they're fast, efficient and organized when it comes to taking customer's orders. Although there were about 15+ people in line, I was out of the bakery in about 20mins with my order. Left with 2 dozen of yummy goodness. I left with a dozen of cheese roll (light, fluffy and flaky pastry filled with creme cheese), a dozen of guava/cheese strudels (flaky puff pastry filled with guava jam and creme cheese), an almond danish, and four potato balls (mashed potato ball filled with seasoned ground beef and peppers). My total was around $22 for all the items mentioned. Wish we had more time to dine-in and try the lunch menu. \u00a0If you're ever in the Burbank area craving for something sweet, definitely check out Porto's. If you don't have a sweet-tooth, order a few potato balls, you won't regret it!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Michelle S.", "time": "7/12/2014"}, {"content": "Everything that comes from Porto's is magic!

They have an insane amount of business and they still manage to stay more consistent than most.. \u00a0Their food is good, and some dishes are great, but their pastries are second to nun, paired with some amazing coffee or fresh squeezed OJ.

But the desserts are to DIE for!!!Tiramisu, triple chocolate, guava cheese rolls, ugh, just writing those out is making me want some badly!All the cakes look BEAUTIFUL! Just to let you know how beautiful they are... My sister's flight from Austin to SF with a stopover in LA got messed up, so she had to spend the night in LA; her mother-in-law's birthday was the next day, and we stopped at Porto's to buy a cake for her. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, my sister took pastries and a cake with her on the plane! And 4 more single-serves to enjoy on the same day.The iced teas are pretty good too.

They will go to the back and then you just wait. When the person got everything you ordered (that can be to go such as pastries and potato balls), she will then tell the cashier what you order and then you pay. \u00a0You kind of have to stand off to the side and wait until the lady comes out with your stuff. \u00a0There were so many people and workers that I forgot what the lady looked like but luckily they know who they helped! \u00a0Thank God! \u00a0I ordered the Pan con Lechon (roasted pork sandwich) $4.99- Slow roasted pulled pork, grilled onions, and mojo (Cuban garlic sauce), on Cuban bread. \u00a0OMG this sandwich was to die for! \u00a0The meat was so tender, juicy, and soft with lots of flavor!! \u00a0The meat literally just melts in your mouth! \u00a0I love how all the dishes comes with their famous plantains! \u00a0Super crispy, perfectly salted, and super delicious! \u00a0Compliments very well with any dish and even just by itself!I also go the famous potato balls! \u00a0I think they are 90 cents each if I'm not mistaken! \u00a0They are famous for these and it is literally dinner in a ball! \u00a0You get a little bit of everything from meat, sauce, mashed potatoes! \u00a0Reminds me Violet and her 3 course dinner from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory! Parking can be pretty difficult so just find street parking in the neighborhood. \u00a0When we got our food, we waited in another line until a table opens and that is how you find a seat! \u00a0Very convenient instead of looking around for oneNOTE:-Outside seating so perfect for dogs!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Diana T.", "time": "7/6/2014"}, {"content": "Try the mango cheesecake!!! \u00a0Best thing ever!!! \u00a0Plus it's not expensive to muy the whole cake only 24dollars!!!", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Lizbet P.", "time": "7/10/2016"}, {"content": "I've been here many times, so I could have done a review years ago (but figured everyone knows about how great this place is, so why should I bother adding my 2 cents), but decided after today's outing that I had to rave about this place.

It's Christmastime, so they're busier than usual. I was very impressed today how organized they were in their chaos. No one was mad when I asked them to switch the stuff they plated to a to go box. They had a line where a worker was directing us to empty seats. The lines went very fast, and food was delivered very quickly. And when we sat down and asked for a box it was promptly brought to me by another employee. Props to Porto's!

They count on memorizing your order, but I had one occasion where they missed a few pastries here and there. No big deal. I would suggest making it a bit easier for them by writing out a list of big orders. It helps speed up the process.
