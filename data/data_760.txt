[{"content": "I can't remember the last cafe/bakery that hustled and bustled as much as this one. We came here to kill time while waiting for my beloved Conan O'Brien taping to start.When you first walk in the door, you can either wait in line on your left or right. If you ask me what's the difference between the two, I couldn't tell ya. We didn't know what the hell we were doing or where to go, so we just chose the line on our right. If you're new like us, it might help to grab a menu before you enter the line, which is located on the counter directly in front of you when you walk in the door. When it's your turn to order, you're supposed to tell the person on the other end of the counter what you want to order. Don't let the counter of desserts fool you though. You can order cafe food also. They'll put together your order and walk over to the cash registers, where you'll pay, grab your number and sit at a table.The dining area was a nightmare. The tables and chairs were all so close together, and it was so loud and packed that you pray that no emergency will break out that would cause evacuation. Initially, no tables were open, but we got lucky that one guy was leaving. That row of tables were so incredibly close to each other that you'll hear the next table's conversation, and you'll have to suck it up (and by it, I mean your gut if you have one) and inch your way through if you're sitting on the inside!Since other Yelpers raved about the potato balls, I definitely had to try those! I also ordered plantain chips. My boyfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja sandwich, which came with plantain chips. The plantain chips were good but needed a dipping sauce. I would highly recommend ordering the Ropa Vieja sandwich because that tasted great, very savory and juicy. The potato balls were good too.It wasn't until I sat down that I realized I was suppose to get a garlic dipping sauce with them. When a server dropped off our food, I requested for the garlic dipping sauce. My gut instinct was telling me that she wouldn't bring it to me because she seemed so overwhelmed trying to drop off other people's orders. I was right! While my boyfriend went to go ask for sauce from an employee behind the counter, an overweight girl squeezed her way into the seat next to me all while her junk was resting on our table along the way. Maybe that's why I ended up not liking the garlic sauce or feeling that hungry?One regret I have is not ordering any type of dessert or smoothie. They had so many delicious-looking desserts that on a normal day, I'd probably spoil my sweet tooth and order almost every single one just to try them.It would be a great experience if you come here during non-peak hours or grabbed things to go instead.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Shirley J.", "time": "6/22/2014"}, {"content": "LOVE LOVE LOVE \u00a0this place been coming here for years, never leave with the potato balls at least 8 of them, freeze some for later and only $.98/each .

It's not to soggy and was rich and flavorful!Potato balls speak for themselves, fried deliciousness! Meat inside well seasoned. Perfection.

But one at a time...I will come for them all. This place use to be less crowded back when I was in high school. lol...I fail to have an account earlier.

This bakery is amazing. I've only ever had pastries from here because friends would always bring them back whenever they made a trip to LA. And now I know why. The bakery is incredible! The prices are ridiculously cheap and the pastries are super delicious! No wonder there is a line around the block just to get in and order.We left with three boxes and I seriously started regretting not ordering more as soon as I left the line. My favorite was probably the chicken croquette. Potato + chicken deliciously mixed into a ball. I also got an assortment of danishes all of which were delicious (my favorite was the pear) and one cinnamon roll which was tasty as well (no raisins inside which I was very pleased with).The boyfriend loved the potato balls which had curried meat in them and the meat pie of course. The cheese pastries are a must get as well. I like the ones with guava mixed in as well, but the boyfriend loves just the cheese ones the most.Long story short: small parking lot so you may have to find street parking, line may be out the door but it moves fairly quickly, must gets are: chicken croquette, potato balls, and cheese pastries. Even if you order a lot of delicious pastries, your wallet won't be crying when you leave!
