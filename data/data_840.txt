Not only is their food amazing, but the staff there is on top of things and are able to crank out tons of orders even though there are always tons of people there. Parking was actually not that bad today. On to the food: I tried a new sandwich today, the medianoche preparada, and it was simply amazing. I don't know how I'll ever order another sandwich from there. The plantain chips on the side were perfect, as usual. Of course, I also ordered potato balls and meat pies, along with dessert (tres leches and Oreo cheesecake). It was all phenomenal and now I want to take a lovely nap at my desk.

Wonderful combination.Potato Balls are crispy outside but with a soft potato & ground beef mix inside.Pastel con carne is a soft & pastry that should never be missing from your order.Dulce De Leche Latte was rich & sweet.

There's this place a little more close to my house that looks like Portos they serve almost the same products. But Portos is still the best! I tried the citrus chicken plate for the first time...I love it! I'll order it again. The beans and chicken has so much flavor! I also ordered the mango smoothie...that I would say is not fresh. It tastes like concentrated mango juice blended with ice. I wish they put fresh mangoes like how they do with their orange juice. The mango smoothie tastes artificial. Then I ordered the Guava Roll and Cheese Roll...those two are a staple. If you order it you'll not be disappointed. I was going to order the potato meat balls, which is great as well...but I was not in the mood for it.
