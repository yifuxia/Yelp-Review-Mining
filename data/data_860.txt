[{"content": "This was a tough one for me. I wanted to give them 3 stars because my friend ordered a sandwich and we literally waited 30 minutes for it to come to our table because they didn't tell her they were out of what she ordered at the register and then kept forgetting to make her new one. My friend also didn't get the plaintain chips with hers. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt though and say they were just having a bad day (though with a place as busy as Portos always is, I don't know how it doesn't happen more often).All that aside, Porto's is absolutely one of those places everyone should go to, especially if you live in SoCal. Their pastries are like no other and the potato balls? Oh man. Not to mention it's completely affordable. On this trip I paid $9 for a Perrier, 4 potato balls, a strawberry cheese pastry and 2 guava strudels. Their Cubanos look amazing too. They have other items like authentic Cuban soda and their cakes are ornate and look to die for. It's a little crazy with the ordering. You have to know what you want cause you won't have a ton of time to look before your order gets taken. They'll get your food and then you meet the same person at the cash register and they'll ring you up. A little Porto's process 101 for you. They have two separate lines too, one if you just want sandwiches or coffee and some pastries and one if you want all the pastries, potato balls, etc.There will always be a wait here, there just will because it's that good. We went not long before closing and there were still at least 20 people in line. The thing I like about this location though is there is a pretty good amount of seating and the location itself is nice. I've been to the one in Glendale too but it's a little older and the seating is kind of spread out oddly. I was super surprised parking wasn't an issue when we went. There's just a smallish lot in the back that offers free parking which is great. The Glendale location has a similar thing going on and parking was insane. We might have just hit it at a good time. But seriously, whatever location you make it to, I can't say enough good things about Porto's and their food even though this visit had its issues.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Jackie W.", "time": "4/7/2015"}, {"content": "I went in last week with my boyfriend. It was his first time having Porto's so we decided to buy boxes of Cheese Rolls and Potato Balls. The line was long as expected but we didn't mind the wait. When it was our turn to order, there was a slight delay because the Potato Balls ran out quickly. Our server, Zamor was so nice and was very accommodating. While waiting, he gave us samples of his favorites and the newest cheese ball flavor while we waited.

The cheese rolls are absolutely amazing. They're flaky and just the right amount of sweet.

It's still about 30 minutes away from where I live so I wasn't too keen on traveling far for food. \u00a0I went on a hike this past Saturday and my friends wanted to eat here which worked out since I was already on a mission. \u00a0We pulled up to a crowded parking lot which is always a red flag for me. \u00a0We immediately found a spot. \u00a0Once we turned the corner and I saw that long line down the street I immediately reached for my keys to leave but remembered I didn't drive so I was committed. \u00a0Let me just say, I was starting to get excited for this experience. \u00a0I have an aversion for lines and wait times but this line moved quickly! \u00a0The food speaks for itself. \u00a0Everything I had was amazing and they freaking offer samples...multiple samples which my inner fat boy shed tears of joy for. \u00a0This is one well oiled machine much deserving of its reputation. \u00a0It gets crowded on the weekends but is totally worth joining the masses.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Greggory S.", "time": "8/28/2015"}, {"content": "This place has some of the best dessert I have ever had... for breakfast!
