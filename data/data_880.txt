[{"content": "One of the best bakeries I've ever been to in U.S! Prices are reasonable and way cheaper than in fancy Bottega Louie (however, it is a great place as well), but the quality is on the same level. Their pastry selection is quite wide and would probably satisfy anyone's taste. The parking is pretty big, didn't have any problem to find a spot. Highly recommend it to everyone! P.S.

I love everything about this place, the coffee, the desserts, the sandwiches, even the LINE! Every time you go, you MUST buy at least a dozen of potatoe balls, some croquets, a spinach and cheese croissant thingy, something sweet. Every time I go, I must try something new, as in sweet, savory, chocolaty goodness!!!! Oh, and the coffee, its a pick me up, every time!!!! I'm even debating on getting my wedding cake from here.

While my husband and I waited 45 long minutes in a large crowd to pick up our friend's PREORDERED cake ( just ridiculous ), I just saw a huge and wonky wedding cake cake that some poor family undoubtedly paid \u00a0A LOT of money more for ,go by. The cake was tilted to one side , and the tiers clearly off center, this was obviously not a design decision but the result of sloppy execution. Virtually no attempt had been made to rectify this with any embellishment what so ever. The wedding cake was picked up by a woman in her wedding finery and sporting a corsage, which let me know she was on the way to the wedding . What could she do at that point but leave with it as it was. Not one of the employees made any attempt to apologize, they clearly were pretending that nothing was amiss and hoping the woman didn't notice . SHAME ON YOU PORTOS ! \u00a0That was a disgusting display of \u00a0disregard for your customers and a \u00a0reproachful lack of \u00a0professional ethics.

Requesting we stop by a bakery by name? Uhh, okay. Now I know why she wanted to go so badly. The food is super good, but so reasonably priced! I thought this was going to be some trendy LA bakery where they bake chia seeds into vegan muffins and charge $7 for a drip coffee, but Porto's is the complete opposite. Delicious food that actually tastes homemade, with a lot of items less than $1? I'm sold.On our first visit, we got 2 potato balls, 1 cheese roll, and 1 cheese-guava roll. On our next visit, we rushed here before heading to the airport and got a dozen potato balls, 6 chicken croquettes, 6 cheese rolls, 2 each of the chorizo and meat pies, 2 chicken empanadas, and a Cubano sandwich. Yeah, we were that in love. As a plus, Porto's offers both cold and hot options for the potato balls, depending on whether you want to eat them immediately, or save them for later. That was a nice touch.And as a final testament to Porto's popularity: while we were in line at LAX, clutching our precious Porto's bag, I overheard the lady behind us comment to her travel companion that we were bringing Porto's and how good it was.
