I don't really have anything bad to say about this place, so I have no choice but to give it a five. I'm not even a sweets lover, but I love coming here & buying em' for those who are. Efficient & great customer service. Great prices. Decent sammies. Decent drinks, like the green tea smoothie which I wouldn't expect to be decent. Bomb guava cheese rolls.Even my mama likes the plain cheese rolls. Cupcakes are mediocre, just super sweet icing per usual. Potato balls taste like Taco Pocket in spherical form. I didn't care for Taco Pockets in school. Easily stays fresh for a couple days. Outdoor seating for your furry friends. Anyways, I believe there is something here for everyone. Prove me wrong.

I used to come here a lot to get small desserts because they were so tasty and relatively inexpensive compared to some places!

Now, I come here to pick up pastries, meat pies, potato balls, etc., for my coworkers. The one pastry that I do love is the coconut and the guava strudel one :D Mmmmm. I've surprisingly never have gotten their sandwiches or the plantains that everyone talks about. I have gotten their omelet before and it was pretty good; however, I'll stick to their desserts and pastries.

I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered and everything is reasonably priced, which we all know is rare in this city. My favorite sandwiches are the steak torta and medianoche. And you can't take a trip to Porto's without getting some of their plantain chips and potato balls - too good! Their pumpkin latte, green tea latte, and mango smoothie are all amazing as well. I've ordered a personalized birthday cake there and they made it exactly to my liking. When I compared prices at other cake shops, Porto's was almost 1/2 the price and I guarantee probably tastes better than any of those other ones. Everyone loved the cake and wanted to know where I got it from. Their guava pastries are to die for as well. Actually all their pastries are great! Their spinach and ham croissants are delish too.If you can't tell, I pretty much love everything on the menu!

I have never been to a place like this and I wish there were more like them around the Valley or even where I live. This place has several choices from their baked good, to their pies/cakes or even their highly recommended cuban specialties. Their potatoes balls and their cuban sandwiches are a must try. My kids love when I bring home an assortment of their baked goods. Its hard to explain how busy thisn place can get but it doesnt faze the employees at all. This place kills all the bakeries/delis/sandwich shop. They have everything from fresh baked breads to any desert you can think of and they best sandwiches ever.

Coming here could be a little confusing the first time because there are two lines that are pretty much the same thing... then I start wondering why everyone keeps standing in the longer line. Anyways, it doesn't matter which line you stand in. The line on the right just has more selection of pastries to look at. If you want to sit, get your order number then sit somewhere or be seated by one of the staff members.* Potato Ball ($0.90) - Soft mashed potato ball filled with seasoned ground beef and fried. For any potato and beef lovers, this is absolute heaven. It's best when eaten fresh, though I have friends who take boxes of them to-go. * Pastrami Sandwich ($5.98) - Contains pastrami, pickles, mustard, and mayonnaise, on a French roll. Pretty standard pastrami sandwich. It comes with plantain chips, which I'm not a fan of, but maybe some people like them.* Caprese Sandwich ($6.98) - Best sandwich I have tried on the menu so far! It has prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, capers, butter, and Italian dressing. So fresh and refreshing.* Beef Torta ($6.98) - Grilled steak, black bean spread, guacamole, cotija cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes... how does that NOT sound amazing? If you are looking for a more hearty and warm sandwich, I would highly recommend this. For the road, I ordered a Guava-Cheese Strudel ($0.80) which was not as filled with stuff as I expected or hoped, but it was still very tasty and flaky! Since they are constantly baking pastries to meet high demands, you can always count on everything here to be as fresh as possible.
