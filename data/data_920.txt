They can PM me on yelp. I was given a wrong $40 order, given cheese balls INSTEAD of potatoe balls (15 of them) the kid helping me was horrible, gone for far to long \"heating up the balls\" the wrong ones. My receipt reads two mochas and then \"3 extra\" ..three extra what? Again almost forty dollars for a botched order and when I call, of course nobody picks up and I've been waiting long enough almost fifteen minutes (on the place an order option mind you, the only option) and nobodies come on to even hear what has happened. The place was dirty today and far understaffed. I want my order reconciled, I'm just not going to sit on hold to even begin my complaint for over fifteen minutes. Again pm me immediately to resolve the issue as I have the receipt and photos. Such a bummer. Been coming here for many years.

The potato balls, guava rolls, cheese rolls, guava AND cheese rolls, sandwiches, cakes, dulce de leche kisses, and breads are indescribably tasty. What amazes me even more is how cheap Porto's is. Both times that I have been to the bakery, I have walked out with at least 3 boxes of things. The quality and price of the food only makes you want to buy more and more until you've tried every single thing offered here. The wait is more than worth it. You absolutely will not regret stopping by!

Everyone says this is the on place you must stop by while in LA, and now I know why. Don't let the long lines intimidate you because they have a ton of staff and the lines move quickly. I walked in and there's two lines. One line for what it looked like lunch food and the other line for baked goods. My choice, baked goods! I was amazed by the wide variety. Cheese rolls are a must. I loved the flakiness to the rolls and the cheese was sweet but not too sweet. I was in love. I bought a dozen for 7.95! I was astonished that it was so affordable.
