[{"content": "I have a love-hate relationship with Porto's.On one hand they produce the most consistent and delicious pastries, but on the other I've rarely left the store paying anything less than fifty dollars (and that's on the low end). \u00a0I know everyone raves about the guava cheese rolls, but among their pastries I would have to say their chocolate croissants cannot simply be overlooked. \u00a0Sure it's just another [unhealthy] breakfast item, but this one would blow your mind. \u00a0It's so soft, it feels like it melts in your mouth and the chocolate they use isn't some cheap chocolate they decided to put on. \u00a0It has a nice bittersweet taste that complements the sweet buttery croissant.Among the cakes though, you're going to have to buy their whole fruit tart. \u00a0Now be careful, they have two variations that I'm aware of in regards to this delectable treat. \u00a0One uses canned fruits and the other uses fresh berries. \u00a0If you're into canned fruits, I guess you'll be fine (and honestly it still tastes fricking delicious), but I quite enjoy blueberries, kiwis, and raspberries on mine. \u00a0Now from what I've noticed is that if you order the whole fruit tart they'll normally bring you the canned fruits one unless you prompt them for the other one.You also gotta try their chicken croquettes, I can nibble on those all day long.", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "name": "Semarath B.", "time": "1/22/2015"}, {"content": "So I came in this morning and need a cake amazingly there were no lines LOLBeen coming to Portos for over 10 yrs most of them at the Glendale location!The lady manager with the bleached out short hair...wow.. This is management! So I wanted a cake and asked me if I needed anything else? I said yes some..mind you no lines, no wait, they are standing around looking around! When I told her I also needed cheese tools and 2 potato balls! She informed me \" not sure if you will take it the wrong way but when you get on line cake the line is just for cakes!\" I looked around still no lines or people around on the bakery line n cake line! Why ask a customer if I need something else if your not go by to help them (management)! I would understand this to be true if it were busy, but with no one in sight...customer service trumps!!! Instead of making the customer walk over to another line which is empty to order the rest of the things you need! Funny thing is I have been there at the cake line many times and ordered food and pastries and never had a problem!

Their cakes including the fruit tart and tres leches with berries were both moist and delicious without being sickeningly sweet. I love that most of the pastries are less than 2 bucks and the line they have for people who pre-order cakes or cheese rolls by the dozen (they'll also grab anything else you want to order so you can skip the long line).I bring all my friends here when they visit and we also buy \"extra\" pastries that always end up being eaten before we even get to the car.

They take phone orders, so if you know what you want, call it in.Favs: fruit tart, guava cheese rolls, cheese rolls, chocolate cake, and croissants!The so-so stuff.

I went here with my friend during the middle of the week at around 6:30. The line was out the door despite it being during the week. There were maybe at least 40 people on line. The people working there seemed overwhelmed and we were constantly passed off to different people. To top it off, I was supposed to get my fountain drink cup way before getting my food, but they didn't give it to me until I asked....I had the chicken plate. The portion was rather small. The food was just meh. The chicken didn't have that much flavor and was overcooked. I had one of the potato balls and it actually was pretty good but not enough to make me wait on a huge line. Got to go a cupcake and apple strudel. Again good but not \"Let's stand online forever\" good. Parking oddly enough, wasn't bad. They have a lot but it wasn't totally full. The tables are hard to come by. Because it's so busy the sound is fairly loud. I doubt I would return.I have no idea how this place has perfect reviews. Don't understand the hype... Do people like it just because the prices are fairly low and because it has been trendy to like it? The food wasn't particularly good.... I feel like most Yelpers give it such high scores because some wonderful A list person like Tori Spelling said she goes to Porto's.
