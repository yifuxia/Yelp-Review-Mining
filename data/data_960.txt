An apple pastry like turnover that oozed perfection from sight, smell and of course taste. The guava cheese pastry. The simply 'cheese', too. It's all so good. I'd never physically been to Porto's, and I was prepared for a wait in line. Luckily, and cluelessly, I showed up just after 8am, and there wasn't much of a line. The bakery team is busy shepherding pastry lovers, and it pretty soon when I had a team member all to myself. I asked plenty of dumb questions, surely, but she was patient and helpful and not a bit phased by my newbishness. I was even given a Dulce de leche to enjoy as we assembled a box of treats. Like they need another killer review, but I was so happy that they are so very much the real deal. They aren't resting on any laurels. They make it happen, obviously, every day. Color me blown away.

After my visit recently, I'm convinced all have been created over the last few weekends. It's crazy how crowded this place gets! The phrase organized chaos comes to mind. The staff seems to have a good system going and the lines move pretty swiftly. Just have this in mind when you come here, you are NOT likely to get some personal attention. Don't expect any.Recommended: the cheese rolls of course, potato balls (like eating cheesy, buttery mashed potato), the cubano sandwich was tasty too.

The line may seem long, but it moves fairly quickly (and you need that time to decide!). While you're in the line, I'd recommend you to make your choices soon, because once they call you to order, you won't be able to move around the isle to view the various assortment of sweet and savory pastries, cakes, mousses, etc. This was the only negative... but I guess it can't be helped since it's so popular! ^^ Dulce de Leche Kisses - crispy shortbread cookie encasing a dulce de leche filling inside. Only 50 cents a pop! Really good deal. Just too sweet for me. Chocolate chip cookie - Chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Too buttery though.Chocolate grand marnier mousse cake - majority of the cake was chocolate mousse, with only a bit of cake... although I should have expected that as a mousse cake. It was again, really really sweet and buttery rich.Love Porto's for the price and just how exciting it is to go there (the hype! so many desserts and savory snacks!) but just everything was really sweet and buttery for my tastes.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Yoojin S.", "time": "2/28/2015"}, {"content": "Every time we go to LA to visit families, we always make a point to stop by this place on our way home.Though the line is always long and out on the street, it goes pretty fast.

When we buy, we end up bringing home about 7 boxes of dessert. This time, my mom bought Dolce de Leche shapped like kisses candy. It's pretty good and not sweet. Not sure what to tell you whether to come early or later as this place is always busy and the lines are long.

It was pretty good, but not up to par with the quality of Bottega's.The turkey croissant, creme brulee, and fruit tart were all phenomenal as always.

I always get like 5 boxes minimum just to share with my friends and family.The only little problem is about how nice the servers are. It might be because of how busy it is that made them look so tired.
