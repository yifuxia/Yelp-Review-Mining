Everybody that works behind the counter can take your order and there are more than enough staff to serve whatever size the herd may be. IMO, the wait seems less than you assume it to be which is surprisingly pleasant.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My advice: Don't let the swamp/herd discourage you and get any of their strudels.", "rating": "4.0 star rating", "name": "Quan X.", "time": "10/19/2015"}, {"content": "Two words.

I called on Saturday to place an order for a custom cake for my sons 2nd birthday party which was the following Saturday. They told me I had to be in the store to place an order. I asked if I could come In the next day and they said to come and I did not need to make an appointment. On Sunday I went there and was told that I would not be able to place an order for a custom cake, They were no longer taking orders. When I asked to speak to a manager the employee started to explain to him what happened and the manager did not even acknowledge my presence. He bluntly said no we can't do it to the employee and walked away. I have come here for multiple occasions and have been a repeat customer. To be treated with so little respect was very disappointing. As delicious as the cakes are I think I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future. I also work at the hospital near by and will be sure to pass on my experience.

I'm so glad that they now have reserved tables for people with numbers. It's no longer like survival of the fittest looking for a place to sit because there are floor attendants who help you get a table. This system is an improvement and makes the experience more enjoyable!!!Today I had the steak torta and a pina collada pastry. The steak was juicy and the guacamole fresh. LOVE the plantain chips. My pina collada pastry had shaved coconut on top of whipped cream. Beneath was a moist cake with fresh pineapple.

However, this review is about my experience today and problems I encountered. When I arrived at 6:30am, there were plenty of parking spots, so it was quick and easy to get inside. The line for the bakery side was relatively short, and since in the past there were always multiple workers helping out and processing orders quickly, I thought that I would be in and out, in no time. Unfortunately, this was not the case. There were only 2 workers taking orders, despite the fact that several other workers were occupied with (what seemed to be) less important tasks, such as arranging more cakes in the display case, than attending to waiting customers. Some staff seemed to lack a sense of urgency and made little effort to move at a faster, weekday morning rush, pace. \u00a0I have visited this location before and seen at least 6 different workers very efficiently taking orders and moving through the line quickly, so I was disappointed that the same effort was not being put forth today. After all, since it was a weekday before 7am, I'm sure I wasn't the only customer in line that had someplace to be, such as work or a meeting.Second, I was frustrated because there were 2 customers at the very front of the line who were taking quite a long time to customize several boxes of orders. This would have been fine, except for the fact that there were only 2 workers available, which caused a complete hold up in the line. I understand that people like to carefully select each pastry in their box, but I can think of plenty of ways to expedite the order process. Perhaps an electronic checkout where you can select all the pastries on a screen at the front, or even a paper slip where you fill out \u00a0what you want and hand it to the counter... One of the gentlemen in front of me did exactly this- wrote out his order on a post it note- and I thought it was a perfect idea.Porto's has great food and bakery goods, but I hope that it can expedite its ordering system for future customers stopping by during the morning rush hour.", "rating": "2.0 star rating", "name": "Hana S.", "time": "7/21/2015"}, {"content": "It reminds me of my childhood favorites..
